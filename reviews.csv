The 9/10 movie I'll never watch again.,"Personal Rating: 9/10

This movie shattered me. There's the expression that something ""tugs at your heartstrings,"" well this movie ripped mine out.

I'll be honest, I could find things to critique about this film, the instance of a scene that was used twice and felt sloppy perhaps; but this movie never claimed to be perfect, just to be emotionally moving, and that it certainly is. This review is written by a boy who also finds himself on the edge of adolescence and adulthood, does that mean I'm biased, absolutely, but everyone who watches this film is, everyone can relate. Your feelings I can assure you will be the same as mine when the credits start rolling, rolling like the tears down your cheeks.

This movie makes you think. Conformity is easy, conformity is comfortable, conformity gets you good grades, trust me you're listening right now to a past perfect GPA teacher's pet. The thing conformity doesn't give you though, is a life, one worth living. For something to be beautiful it must also have a side of danger, and that's what freedom of thought is, as is mentioned in the movie ""we must constantly look at things in a different way,"" and that's beautiful! Yes, it means at times we don't agree, yes it means you might give this movie a 4/10 but I'll be damned if that changes my opinion of it.

The themes this movie explores such as, never letting a moment slip by where you don't think for yourself, where you don't seize an opportunity, it does so beautifully. Robin Williams was not acting he was believing, everything in this movie comes across as genuine, a slice of reality, a harsh but beautiful one at that.

Will I watch this movie again, I don't think so. But please, please watch it just once, you won't ever regret it.

Carpe Diem.",9
Thank You Captain,"It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.

The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is, in one way or another, influenced by Mr. Keating, be that positively or, unfortunately, negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay, is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people, and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course, I, personally, embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.

As I've seen here on IMDb, this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise, but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day, and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person. May we all Carpe Diem

Anti-conformity at its most inspiring.,"Do not go where society tells you to. Find the things you love and pursue them with every fibre of your being until the day you die. That's the message I took from Dead Poets Society. Weird, inspiring and heartbreaking, DPS is a one of a kind film and one of the reasons Robin Williams is so renowned worldwide as not just a comedian, but a remarkable actor as well. After watching this movie you'll want to change the world. Amazing!",9
A powerful antidote to conformism,"There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.

Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.

I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our ""homework"" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.

Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.

The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.

So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.

10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.",10
Seize the Day- One of the Greatest Movies Ever!,"Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.

The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or ""Oh Captain, my Captain"", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.

There are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he's so embarrassed.

Peter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie ""Master and Commander"" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.

Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that ""he wanted to throw up at the end of the film"". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",10
"Carpe Diem, because the days don't stand still","First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with ""It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s."" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.

Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.

Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.

And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.",10
Make Your Lives Extraordinary,"So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams' untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly ""moved"" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry.",10
Wonderful look at loss of innocence,"After all these years I have never seen this film and I'm sorry it took me this long. Dead Poets Society impressively captures the internal deliberation of young, impressionable men to both take direction from their leaders and role models and at the same time chart their own path against questionable influence and authority. Until the unthinkable occurs, these boys travel through the story displaying all of the wonderment of adolescent development with infectious optimism. After experiencing tremendous loss, the conflict between them shows the struggle each character faces in determining the extent to which they're willing to uphold their developing convictions.",7
"""Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.""","Australian director Peter Weir's third picture in Hollywood, 'Dead Poets Society (1989),' doesn't really explore any territory that has not been covered before. For most of the film, we can pretty much predict exactly where Tom Schulman's screenplay is heading, and so there are few surprises to set it apart from other movies of its kind. However, despite his film's hint of unoriginality, Weir hardly puts a foot wrong, and 'Dead Poets Society' proves a thoughtful, funny, haunting and inspirational drama that'll certainly stay with you once you've seen it. Accompanying a cast of bright, young actors {some of whom you'll recognise from their later successes, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard} is comedy veteran Robin Williams, whose warmth and passion forms the emotional core of the story.

The prestigious Welton Academy prep school (""Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence""), as they're four-pillar motto suggests, has a long-standing history of success and high reputation. The young male students of the college are expected, at all times, to respect rules and authority, and to continually strive for greater and greater academic achievements. Into the school comes former student, now English teacher, John Keating (Williams), whose unorthodox approach to lessons, and vigorous passion towards literature and poetry, inspires many of his impressionable young students, and severely ruffles the feathers of Welton Academy's management. Keating's rousing motto of ""carpe diem"" (a Latin phrase meaning ""pluck/seize the day,"" borrowed from Horace's ""Odes 1.11"") inspires the young boys to make the most of every opportunity, and to look within themselves to discover the correct path for their lives.

The film proved quite successful at the 1990 Academy Awards, acquiring an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and nominations for Best Actor (Robin Williams), Best Director (Weir's second nomination in that category) and Best Picture. Perhaps because of the preparatory school setting and the cast of young actors, 'Dead Poets Society' seems as though it would be most effective with young teenage boys, who will relish the film's opposition towards conformity and strict authority. Nevertheless, the film also boasts a more important moral from which we can all take something: always seize the opportunities that are presented to you, and make every day of your life count.",7
A masterful tribute to teaching at its best,"Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.

The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.

Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of ""seizing the day"". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless ""Introduction to Poetry"" from the time honored Pritchard textbook!

The ""Dead Poets Society"", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).

Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama.

Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.

It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.

This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.",10
Poetry on the screen,"Not only will this movie touch your heart and bring tears, it will inspire you to be a better teacher to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries may be. It is truly poetry on the screen... a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now. It has taken my love of poetry to an entirely new level!",10
Deserving 10/10,"A rare 10/10 and it's deserving of such. This movie had a profound impact on me....and no better person to play it then the great Robin Williams.

He acted with such emotion and intensity and vigour in each scene. It is RARE to feel like I'm inside the film, but in this case I felt like Robin Williams was constantly talking to me in this film.

Alongside him, the rest of the cast did a great job.

This movie was more than just acting. It represented how a person should live and enjoy life. Thank you for such a gem.",10
"this movie is the greatest movie, with excellent cinematic techniques.","The film Dead Poets Society is a film that explores the idea of ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day) from the viewpoint of a classroom of young men at an all boys boarding school. Their teacher Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams)helps them stretch their minds, and exercise their right to defiant acts of love for life and poetry, rebuttlng society. The director Peter Weir treats you with eye candy by using various camera shots of beautiful scenary, and neat techniques. Weir takes you on a roller coaster that leaves you gripping your seat, enjoying life, and thinking ""Carpe Diem"" in your own life. There are some very depressing scenes, but they are very artful, and teach you of appreciation for those brave members of society that dare stand up for their beliefs, and rights to wrestling around with life. I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized. I just saw this film in English class, but I immediatly fell in love with it, as I know you will.",10
A Story of Inspiration,"English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) inspires his students to discover their love for poetry and seize the day.

This is a story about what one teacher (or a mentor of any kind) can do to inspire the youth, whether it be for good or evil. Those viewing this film will generally see it as a force for good, a call to ""seize the day"". And that is probably the correct interpretation.

But interestingly, the call for non-conformity leads to its own kind of conformity. And one could argue that Keating's power is not much different than that of a politician or cult leader. Had he chosen to use it differently, he could have been a very dangerous force in these young men's lives. In fact, we see not everyone who followed his path was better because of it.",7
Pure excellence...,"I watched this movie today for about 15-th time. I'm never bored with it. A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting. There are many good films.Also there are probably many better than this one;cause it's not flawless. But if you believe that a movie can change your life, I have no doubts that this one can influence you as no other. If you have not watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Go to the video rentals and buy it.Yes, don't rent it but buy it.It's a movie that you will watch many times.Perhaps it will even save you..As it had saved me..",10
Words and ideas can change the world,"Dead Poets Society was one of my favourite movies when I was about 12 years old. It was a long time ago since I'd last seen it and I kinda expected it to have lost something over the years. Not true at all. The story's message still very much applies today and always will: make something of your life, enjoy it as much as you can.

When you watch this beautifully acted, directed and well shot film, you can't help but be genuinely be seized by emotion. Several scenes are stunning, yet it never gets sentimental and stays sincere throughout the whole film.

Because he was such a fantastic emotional actor, Robin Williams was the perfect choice to play John Keating, an original English teacher who wants his students to think for themselves, not only about poetry but also about life itself. If there'd be a John Keating in every school, the world might just become a little more interesting.

Definitely a must-see classic.",10
extraordinary,"Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as ""A Separate Peace"", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to ""suck the marrow out of life"", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see.",10
Still stands strong after 30 years. Classic drama with touching acting performances and warmhearted direction by Peter Weir.,"A wonderfully, touching uplifting portrait of teenagers coming of age, learning how to think for themselves and experiencing how to live LIFE to the FULLEST, inspired by an unconventional, loving English teacher played brilliantly by Robin Williams, which is one of his best roles of his entire career.

Dramas dont come any better than this one. BUT it isnt a drama for the first hour, because it starts out as an uplifting, vivacious portrait of teenagers at a strict boarding school, where everybody is suffocated by RULES and more rules, UNTIL that special day teacher Robin Williams starts teaching.

This movie can be seen by young and old, but I guess especially young people would really be impressed by it, because this movie, like no other, depicts with suffocating reality, the pressures kids can be burdened with when they have to OBEY their parents' will and wishes and when their own creativity and passions are stifled with ruthless restrictions and punishments by their parents and their ""teachers""...

Right now I still have goosebumps merely thinking about this movie. It's so profoundly, impressive and touching and uplifting. One of the best dramas ever! Yes, EVER!",9
Robin Williams invents a string of school movie clichés,"Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clichés it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.

Set in a prestigious school where the upper lips are stiff, the shirts stuffed and the emotions repressed, a class of teenage boys find their new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) taking a slight detour from the established curriculum. Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse. Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.

What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.

Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.

Dead Poets Society therefore is ultimately a promise that wasn't completely fulfilled as the subtle, intelligent storytelling is blown out of the water by the mishandling of the closing scenes. Consequently, if you're anything like me, you'll spend most of the film trying to guess which kid pops his clogs. It's an enjoyable and involving drama, but as a tear-jerker it fails to move. Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film.",7
"It is cynical, dull, very methodical and slow in development...","... and yet it has grown on me to where it is one of my favorites.

When I first saw this in the theater I felt disappointed and baited and switched. Robin Williams may be top billed, but he is not the center of the film although he is the motivating character. He is a new teacher at an elite private school for boys that has traditions that probably nobody remembers the reasons for. Williams' character is out of step with the rest of the faculty at the school and encourages his students to seize the day. Anyone who grew up with the overbearing-we-expect-more-out-of-you parents, or even attended boarding school, or grew up in some similar environment can identify with the students in the film.

Every aspect of this film is powerful. From screenplay to direction, casting to acting, the movie drags us into a world of teenagers that are REAL. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes rebellious ... sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. This is very much a Peter Weir film. The screenplay is one the most powerful ones ever, and one characteristic of this movie is the evolution the characters go through. Just like Truman Show, Witness, The Last Wave and Fearless, Weir drags his characters into the story and changes them. He evolves them so that, in the end, his characters are more human and feel something beyond traditional beliefs and codes; Things that people have died for throughout history: Freedom, Respect, Pride... things that may not be that important to an average person, things that make one a hero.",8
Dead Students Classroom...,"... Speaking for myself, I don't want to spend a large amount of time in the company of young men who need *permission* to be themselves. If teacher John Keating's role necessitated 'guidance', THEN I could understand, but it doesn't. They all show themselves to have a certain amount of gumption and intelligence outside of the classroom; so why once they get in there are they portrayed as spineless saps who need to be taken by the hand and 'shown the way'?!

Keating (Williams) didn't seem to me to have as much effect as I was led to expect and hoped for as I watched. This was more about the boys just being lucky enough to have a role-model standing in front of them who didn't fit societal norms at the time. The kids weren't taught anything much beyond learning how to follow their own instincts, and really, shouldn't fraternising with your peers teach you to do that adequately enough?!

It's hard to feel sympathy for people who've got all the raw materials already there; but appear to be so feckless that they need to be *pushed* in order to put them to use! Films that show mentoring the disadvantaged are easier to get behind because you're rooting for the underdogs; there's just no such incentive, in this case. This may be much better made than material like ""Dangerous Minds"", but at least in that case there's more 'antagonism' going on underneath the surface...

I still enjoyed the film greatly; but making the circumstances of the pupils more sympathetic straight from the get-go would have turned this film into one of my all-time favourites...",7
Much Better Than Expected!,"Dead Poets Society is a much better film than I anticipated. Honestly, I thought this would be a film all about poetry and I loathe poetry, so I didn't give this film a chance. I'm glad I did because this is not a film about poetry, but about a group of college kids who have been encouraged to follow their own dreams. This film is a well-made drama that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It also has one of the most unexpected scenes I have seen in awhile.

Peter Weir's film is about a group of college kids who are inspired by their English professor, John Keating. Keating tells his kids who follow their dreams and they do just that. Unfortunately, the dean and the parents have other ideas for their kids.

Robin Williams gives a true, inspirational performance as John Keating. He is the teacher that is common nowadays, but someone my parents would yearn to have. Ethan Hawke delivers a stand out performance as one of the kids and so does Robert Sean Leonard.

Overall, this is a truly inspirational film that has one simple message for all people, especially younger ones. This message is ""Follow our dreams and don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do."" This message should have been used back in the 1950's-1960's. This film is well-acted, has great direction, and should leave a tear or two. I rate this film 9/10.",9
Robin Williams proves he's a great actor,"Smart and popular Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) has a domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) who controls his son. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is his new shy roommate in the high class Welton Academy boarding school. John Keating (Robin Williams) is their new English teacher who teaches his students all about living life to the fullest... Carpe Diem. Neil finds an old senior annual where Keating was a part of the Dead Poets Society. The boys decide to resurrect the Society.

The young cast is pretty good led by the quiet Ethan Hawke and a good leading man in RSL. Of course, the teacher in these types of movies is what sells it. Robin Williams controls his wilder instincts to create a very compelling character. It's a little too much poetry for me, but I like the movie otherwise especially the performances.",7
just a few opinions,"First of all, I would like to say that my English is not that good, but I think I can make myself understandable.

This movie made a big impression on me, I saw it for the first time, I think just 2 years ago, I did not heard about this movie before.

One of my favorite actors is Mr. Robin Williams and his playing his part here, as usual perfect.

I totally agree with the one message of the movie, that parents should not put so much pressure on their children and let them take their own decisions.

I like poetry as well and one of my favorite moments in the movie is when the character Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) has to tell his poem in front of the class but he has none and is challenged from his teacher to improvise.... The result is for me one of the most beautiful things I ever heard.

So let's end my ""comment"".

This movie is one of the ""best ever made""!",10
Always question authority,"The conformist 50s get a look in Dead Poet's Society. Seen through the eyes of several prep school kids it's only that several of them really grasp what Robin Williams is trying to teach them that we see hope for the future.

Williams is one of those rare teachers whose unorthodox methods make him stand out. There will always two or three for me in every level of learning that I had who stuck with me. The kids at Welton Prep actually enjoy his poetry class, they even found a little private club the Dead Poet's Society and will quote Byron, Browning, and the Bard back and forth to each other.

The difference between Williams and someone like Norman Lloyd the headmaster at Welton Prep is that Lloyd sees himself as training the future membership of the establishment and he's giving them the lessons they need to get by, Williams says that his function to tell the youth to question authority. Always ask why this is so. Progress is only made by those who ask questions.

The film is mainly the story of two students in his class Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. Leonard is a shy kid and Hawke is a popular one. But Hawke is not from a wealthy family. His father Kurtwood Smith has made many sacrifices to get him into that prep school. Hawke wants to be an actor and Williams says follow your dream. Their clash sets in motion the dramatic events of the climax.

Dead Poet's Society won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director as well. Williams got a nomination for Best Actor. Dead Poet's Society maybe set in the 50s, but it expresses a universal theme about always question the status quo until you get a satisfying answer.

Progress never happens any other way.",9
Impressive.,"I'm impressed. It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.

It's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.

I liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.

I gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me.",8
"good, not great","I think hailing this movie as a classic is a bit too much, but bashing it as a dud is also too extreme.

The movie hoped to be one of those absolutely outstanding, feel-good flicks that changes peoples' lives. It isn't that, and sometimes the stretching it does to try to be so great makes the audience squeam.

It has some good points, good lines, and in my humble opinion, excellent actors portraying the boys in the Society. I am not a big fan of William's casting as Keating though.

The script is a little cliche and the fact that a bunch of fairly popular boys would want to gather and read poetry together is also a bit extreme. I guess what I'm saying is their portrayal of the boys themselves is overall unrealistic (When Neil grabs a cape and runs up and down, excited he's going to be in Midsummer Night's Dream? Teenage boys would not typically do that).

However with all that said, the message of the movie is fabulous. The teaching style of Keating is impressive and, contrary to what most people would think, there are teachers out there who approach teaching in a very unorthodox way and reach their students like no other can. I am a high school student and have seen some of these teachers.

I liked the ending, however bombastic some may call it. Definately watch it, maybe even buy it, but don't expect *too* much.",6
Stirring,"This film ends up on top 10 and 100 lists so often that I think many people (me included!) have a tendency to overlook it and think of it as composed only of those key visual scenes, a story told in fragments of the familiar. Rewatching it recently, however, I was reminded of how brilliant Robin Williams' performance is and how effectively the viewer is also drawn into the group, another member of the secret society, another person holding something important close and willing to defend it. A true classic.",9
Why Is This Film So Popular?,"I re-watched this film 25 years after my first viewing chiefly to the look of horror on friends faces when I told them I didn't enjoy it.

Sure, from the perspective of a 15 year old, it was a little light on violence, nudity and car chases. I was also cajoled in to watching it by an English teacher. These could be two reasons for my negative reminiscence of the film.

Whilst I was able to appreciate the storyline more as a fully grown adult, and appreciate the performance of Robin Williams, I was still unable to understand why everyone I know thinks that this is one of their greatest films.

It's a good film. But I wouldn't rave about it.",6
Boxoffice hit with Robin Williams as an upright teacher who hands perfectly the role,"Splendid , agreeable and often emotive movie with wonderful acting and enjoyable scenes about the relationship between a teacher and his students . Robin Williams is super as the outlandish teacher who gave it all he had . An idealist English teacher (Robin Williams) inspires a septet of poetry students (Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles , Dylan Kussman , Ruggiero..) in a 1950s' prep school . He was their inspiration, he made their lives extraordinary , but unfortunately resulting in clashes with schools and parental authorities . As the offbeat teacher takes on the martinet headmaster (Norman LLoyd) who seeks to protect not the truth but the good name of the school . Indeed so extraordinary and incendiary are his his methods that you wonder how teacher and school ever accepted each other in the first place .

A thoughtful and thought-provoking movie with interpretations uniformly good , in which a teacher teaches his pupils to pursue individuality and creative endeavor . Robin Williams shows he can master the comic as well as serious characters with this brooding portrayal of an unorthodox educator and his students . The film is pretty well , though undermined by a series of improbabilities and occasionally scripted with a heavy hand in order to elevate the message . The ensemble cast is magnificent with Robin Williams showcasing his considerable talents as an innovative and eccentric teacher arriving at an expensive and stuffy public school in Vermont and remaining cast : Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke , Josh Charles , Kustwood Smith, Alexandra Powers , Dylan Kussman , Allelon Ruggiero , Melora Walters, George Martin are top-notch. The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and here are treated ethic and moral issues developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . The film is cleverly displayed throughout with enjoyable and sensitive style. The motion picture takes part of the School Sub-genre , being this prestigious ¨Dead Poets Society¨ (1989) by Peter Weir , its maxim representation along with ¨The emperor's club¨ (2002) Michael Hoffman and ¨Mona Lisa Smile¨ (2003) by Mike Newell .

Adding Maurice Jarre's musical score is appealing and touching , though composed by synthesizer . Likewise , colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman John Seale . The story was well and competently directed by Peter Weir . Famous for making well-known comedy and genre actors into credible dramatic actors such as Robin Williams , Harrison Ford, and Jim Carrey. Peter directed 5 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Linda Hunt, Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, Rosie Perez and Ed Harris. As of 2018, he has directed three Oscar Best Picture nominees: Witness (1985), Dead Poets Society(1989) and Master and Commander (2003), he was also nominated for Best Director for each film . His first succesful movie was ¨Gallipoli¨ that resulted to be the passport to Hollywood for this magnificent filmmaker . He realized numerous interesting stories superbly filmed , with brooding and thought-provoking issues and in his prestigious career deserves special attention the excellent film titled ¨Gallipoli¨ . Weir achieved several hits as ¨The way back¨, ¨Master and Commander¨, ¨Witness¨, ¨The Truman show¨ , ¨Dead poets society¨ , ¨The last wave¨ and some flops as ¨Mosquito coast¨ , ¨The plumber¨ . Rating ¨Dead Poets Society¨ (1989) : 7/10 . Better than average . The picture will appeal to Robin Williams fans . Well worth seeing .",7
Unquestioned totalitarianism,"Actually, the topic of this film could be quite interesting. Its narrative, as I view it, is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students, in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom, can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.

Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle, it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.

Dostoyevski, for instance, was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology, which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But, in my view, in this case, the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism, but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.

I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies, and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society, but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes, such as striving for freedom, that I find it just bad taste.",2
Everybody is a poet. Even you are!,"Not every thing that's expected from you is your only motive of life. This movie in a great manner teaches us to listen and regard the voice of our soul, the voice of our self.

Basically the story is about a English Literature professor Mr. John Keating who is a replacement for the previous professor and is conducting his very first class for the school. His idea of teaching is very different and informal, based more on practicality rather than just reading words written in the book. Being literature his subject, he inspires his students to weave their own thoughts, he encourages them to use their own imaginations. He clearly believes that everybody has their own personal sense of seeing this world, interpretating things in their own way.

The influence of Mr. Keating on the boys can be judged from their inclining interests towards poetries and proses. They reframe Dead Poets Society which is a kind of club of people reading out poetries among the group. Meanwhile, they also learn to listen to their calling. And then series of events goes on and by the end of that, you will be left with tears in your eyes.

Everything in the movie is so perfectly done. The character of Mr. Keating played by Robin Williams is flawless. The smirk on his face puts a different charm and it always keeps you under impression of his control over the situation. Also the character of Neil played by Robin Sean Leonard keeps you gripped to the emotions that the movie is carrying throughout.

This is a kind of movie that will make you think about yourself, your dreams and desires. You will be left with the tears of happiness and a sense of introspection. Moreover, if you have interest in writing or have given it a try sometime, this movie is surely going to boost your morale and confidence.",10
The Powerful Play Goes on.,"There are some movies you watch for fun, there are some movies you watch just to pass time and then there are movies that have a massive effect on your life. This is one of those movies. Dead Poets Society is a coming of age movie that teaches us that life is not only about growing up to have a nice job due to a good education. Life is to be lived with passion, with excitement. Out of all the movies I have watched in the short span of my life, this is by far the best one. Despite the fact that it is from the '80s it continues to inspire people all around the world. Dead Poets Society is an underrated movie with an underrated director. This movie is purely a piece of art, every scene fits seamlessly with the other. The colors, the hues, the lighting matches with every emotion that is displayed in each scene throughout the movie.

Each actor in this movie has amazing skills. First of all, Robin Williams, he has made a place in our hearts from every single heart-wrenching, soul-touching performance on the screen to this date. This movie is no less than the others. Professor John Keating embodies a man that everyone wishes to have as a teacher, he dares to teach things that are more than what you normally hear in a classroom. He shows us the extraordinary, he teaches us how to live, how to feel and most importantly; how to be human. Then, we have Robert Sean-Leonard as Neil Perry, once more extremely underrated. His roles are always filled to the brim with inspiration and emotion. The entire supporting cast is amazing, they provide to the foundation of this movie, without them this movie would not have the same emotional impact.

This movie is a diamond in the rough. It's not difficult for one to fall in love with such a movie. Filled with beautiful scenes, plot twists and numerous references to poets and their works, you are bound to fall in love with the English language.",10
A Tribute to Berry College,"In the fall of 1987, filming had already begun at Berry College, Rome, Georgia. Berry had a set of very old buildings that were designed to look like the buildings at Oxford College in England. These buildings had attracted many filmmakers before. When I visited that fall, they had gone to great lengths to make it look like a more north eastern college, making the trees and landscaping appear in later stages of autumn. We were all very excited, despite the strange name of the movie they were filming - Dead Poets Society.

Unfortunately, they changed their mind. They decided to scrap all the footage the were shooting at Berry College, and move production to a different school. I didn't realize they had changed locations until I went to see the film after its release. I went with high expectations but all I could do was look at the buildings and background and think, ""That's not Berry.""

So even though it was a great film, I still lament that Berry College was dropped and another school chosen, and that Berry does not go down in history as the location where Dead Poets Society was filmed.",8
Seize the day.,"Set in an all boys boarding school, 'Dead Poets Society (1989)' explores what it means to think for yourself in a society that seems to value conformity above all else. With a subtle performance from Robin Williams and equally as down-to-earth turns by its young cast (which includes a fresh-faced Ethan Hawke), the picture crafts a gentle, grounded and emotive experience that achieves its desired effect. The first act is a little slow, as the flick sets up its central concept and characters, and it takes a while for the thing to start affecting as it should, but the overall result is entertaining and, when it needs to be, rather powerful. It takes you through a bevy of emotions and certainly makes its point. It's quite unique, in a way. It mightn't be the most outwardly enjoyable picture, but it's an engaging effort. 7/10",7
One of my favorite endings...,"Dead Poets Society is not a film for everyone. For people who delve too deep into the meaning of the film, you might find yourself rather cheated or disappointed because of its radical nature. However, if you take it for what it is.. A film that wants to incite the senses to accept change; you will end up getting that warm feeling one gets when having a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly December morning. It works itself up from a simple saying ~ Carpe diem, which is Latin for 'Seize the day'. It is what the new English teacher asks his new 17 year old batch of students to do (in quite a bizarre manner). Together with The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it is one of Peter Weir's best films. The football match with Beethoven in the background, and the climax with bagpipes are the two best sequences in the film. I found Robin Williams' impersonation of Marlon Brando and John Wayne hilarious! Dead Poets Society is a film that has been widely criticized for its ending. You will know why once you've see it. As far as film-making goes, the ending is done perfectly. However, it could mean different things to different people. To challenge your views, to look at things differently, give Dead Poets Society a go. It is based in 1959, so don't give it as hard a time as some critics have given it.

O Captain! My Captain! 7/10. I love the ending.",7
Dead poets society review,"I wasn't sure when I first start to watch it. If it would be as good as people kept telling me. But luckily it was so good. I loved the plot, storyline, characters. The character development was great. I loved that the teacher was trying to teach the kids what believed was good even when the school tried to make him be quite. I highly recommend everyone watch this movie at least once in there life.",9
"A Solid Coming-of-Age Film, But Has Aged Quite a Bit","After hearing for years people talk how fantastic of a film this is (some would even say one of the best ever made) I finally decided to check it out. While it was enjoyable, it unfortunately failed to have the impact on me it has had on so many others.

The biggest strength of the film is it's performances. Robin Williams is at it's best here showcasing not just his ability as a comedic actor, but also as a dramatic as well. His character is a fascinating one and anyone who has had a teacher or mentor who was inspiring will be able to relate to his character. What really surprised me though was how well the actors portraying the kids were. This is one of the few films I've seen that is focused intensely around a group of young adults were all of the actors do a great job.

While the film has a good story at it's core, it hits so many of the same beats and themes as other coming-of-age films and stories that it pails in comparison to some of the better ones out there. The story takes a while to kick in as the film gets off to a rather slow start and while the actors do a great job, only one or two of the younger characters are actually interesting. Robin Williams really is the star here and when he disappears for too long the film begins to drag quite a bit. I honestly wish the movie had been focused on his character since he was the most interesting, but that's not the story this movie is trying to tell.

For all my complaints, I still found Dead Poets Society to be an enjoyable film. It has fantastic performances, a good message, and features one of the most iconic (and well-deserving) best final scenes in a movie I've ever seen. But there's no denying that it pales in comparison to some other coming-of-age films due to a predictable story that drags in areas. I have a feeling many of the people who adore this film saw it when they were younger which is why it has stuck with them for so long which is perfectly fine, but anyone who has seen other coming-of-age films might find this one a bit underwhelming.",7
"Oh Captain, My Captain. It Is One Of Robin Williams Best","After recently watching ""Mrs Doubtfire"" And then ""Old Dogs"" a movie from the latter part of the late Robin Williams's career. I decided to revisit some of his earlier dramatic work. And one phrase came tonight ""Oh Captain, my Captain"". so I immediately settled on 1988's ""Dead Poets Society"".

I also forgot about this brilliant quote. ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary"" I don't know if it was the tagline for the movie, but it certainly should have been.

Plot In A Paragraph: Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) has been sent to the school where his popular older brother was valedictorian. His room-mate, Neil Parry (Robert Sean Leonard), although very bright and popular, is under the thumb of his controlling father (Kurtwood Smith) The two, along with their other friends, meet Professor Keating (A brilliant Robin Williams in one of his serious moods) their new English teacher, who tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to seize the day, and make their lives extraordinary.

For an actor well known for his comedic roles, Robin Williams is in fact, a very effective dramatic actor. Kurtwood Smith is his usual reliable self as Mr Perry, the dominating father, and all of the ""boys"" do well in their roles. Ethan Hawke is especially good, likewise Josh Charles, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Henson.

Some may find it boring, and it is slow in parts, but Williams's performance more than papers over the few cracks. Touching, Tragic and humorous in places. The final ""Oh Captain, my Captain"" is spine tinglingly good!! And if be lying if I didn't say I welled up a bit. It really is a very good movie. One that deserves to be seen.",8
An incredible story of poetic freedom,"I watched this movie near one year after the tragic death of Robin Williams, and only for the first time. I had heard about the ""O Captain! My Captain!"" thing and knew it was a very popular film, but what I wasn't prepared for was how deeply emotional it is, and how much it resonates with the passing of Williams. This is a movie that although could be described as trying too hard for emotion, still just makes you want to smile, you want these boys to break out of their closed off traditional world and do what they want to do in life.

The story is about an elite prep boarding school and its students, where some are being worked hard as they await the day they enter college. But in comes Mr Keating, a new English teacher who's ways don't exactly impress the hard up parents and teachers, who's values are very much the underpinning of what the young students despise. The story has its ways of making Williams just great to watch; the young guys who act here work well alongside him and make this a movie that has no central character, but a central story to share.

Directed by Peter Weir, the movie is not all about Robin Williams and the famous scenes that are involved. In fact Weir gives just a fine performance as any other, his directing is finely done and he knows how to control the emotion of the film so that it isn't always one tone. Tom Schulman whose experiences inspired this movie, creates a beautiful script, in fact I am not quite sure if is Weir or Schulman who make this special, but in any case both are on great form.

The rest of the cast pitch in well too, a young Ethan Hawke as the painfully shy Todd is OK, I am not sure if he is good but in any case his more emotional side is fascinating when done. Josh Charles as Knox is also good and the other boys involved such as Robert Sean Leonard are good also. I found if any part of the movie stops this from utter perfection, then the acting is what it is, by no means bad but sometimes a little over the top. As for Williams's nomination for an Academy Award, well maybe I agree, I mean his acting is great here and although I've seen some criticise his comic side coming out here, I for one don't think it was a bad thing.

When you get a film that just makes you think, you know it is fairly special, but one that adds into it emotion too, then it starts to become sublime. This film knows how to challenge perception, and even though this is set in 1959 and made in 1989, the ideas that Keating uses are still inspirational today, and the way in which he talks about poetry can at times be most beautiful. I think again a lot of praise goes to Schulman for creating a script that can mean a lot to someone, watch this at just the right age and this could blow your mind, it really could.

Is it for everyone? well it should be, a movie I would highly recommend to someone even if they don't usually like this kind of movie, simply because of the thought process involved. It isn't even too long, I felt maybe for it to one of the best ever, it had to maybe have had an even better ending than it already does, which is a really fine ending by the way. It should keep you gripped throughout, it never made me feel bored or like I had better things to do, it was a rare movie that spoke to me and opened my mind as I feel the people behind this wanted it to do.",9
Inspiring...,"This movie changed my life, from the haunting soundtrack to the Carpe Diem attitude. It's wonderfully cast and a total inspiration. I bought the original script and the ending was a lot different, I will allow Google to enlighten you. There's a handful of movies you should watch in your lifetime and this is one of them. God Bless Robin Williams...",10
Good but Not Great,"Having taught English for 43 years, I have stood in the place Robin William's character has. Some days you look out over the herds of kids that pass before you and you cry for them. As a teacher who put his heart and soul into what I did, I tried to make impressions help them master life skills. The sad reality is that one does one's best to crack the numbers game. Every year we have a few of those students who we try to embrace and find the right direction for them, but we are so hamstrung. The first thing I thought when evaluating this film is the little group of kids that he dealt with. He got to know each of them intimately. Of course, it's a prep school, but even then he should have had a couple other full classrooms. What he does is admirable and exciting. That he throws himself into his work to such an extent is amazing. But let's face it. This is a formulaic film that has been done many times before. It is monument building and flying in the face of establishment whose soul purpose is to ruin these kids' lives. There's a kind of narcissism to think that in this group we have bunch of directionless idiots who could never think for themselves. It sends a positive message but the population is carefully put together to send that message. It's just not real.",7
"Quite good idea, so-so film","Some films simply don't seem to leave much of an impression; they don't stand out and they don't inspire in-jokes and references to its audience. This film may have tried, but it just really didn't do much for this particular viewer. The plot is good, and the story is one that should be told. The way it's told here works OK, but the film never grabbed me. I never stopped watching or particularly felt like it... the film isn't bad, just somewhat bland. The acting ranges, but is rarely magnificent. The cast has a nice hand-full of people who have done better, given much more convincing performances. The writing ranges. There are a few scenes that work well, maybe even one or two that are downright memorable and good, but then there are the(admittedly only few) underdeveloped sub-plots, and scenes that just don't come off as dramatic as it seems like they were meant to. There are a few technical issues; the editing is at times strange, cutting away or on to the next shot too soon or too late. The cinematography mostly at least works, but there are a few shots that are oddly framed. In the end, this is a decent enough film, it just seems like it could have been considerably better, given the people in front of and behind the cameras(Weir went on to direct The Truman Show). I recommend it to fans of the people involved in making it as well as anyone the plot appeals to. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. 6/10",6
We are Scarred by the Circumstance...,"... in which we are born and moulded without recourse or consultation - as we get older, others may influence and change our direction, sow new seeds, broaden horizons, gouge new scars. We may even become better for it but occasionally we may not and more often than not, we won't even know how we got there.

There's little to like about a wealthy boys only establishment, without ethnic or demographic diversity, run by white middle aged and older men, chained to their dogma and traditions. If, however, you can take hold of the universal message Robin Williams so elegantly and poetically espouses, then maybe, if you're fortunate enough to be washed onto the shore of a similarly inspirational mentor, tutor, teacher or friend, no matter where you are on your journey, just maybe, just maybe, they'll raise enough of a breeze to change your direction. If that new direction takes you away from the rocky coastline of cavernous dogma, and continues to do so for the rest of your days, then the world, your world, will be a far better place for it, regardless of your demography, ethnicity, history or where on the planet your journey begins or continues.

A lesson for all,"This is a film that could change the way many people see life. Really. I saw it for the first time when I was just 8 years old and even then, in the end, the tears came in abundance. Then I saw it again and again, finding some new nuance each time. Professor Keating's groundbreaking point of view would have been illuminating for the future, and not just mine. The lesson is for everyone, it is up to us ""students"" to put it into practice.

"Seize the Day, Make Your Life Extraordinary","Dead Poets Society is one of the few films that are hard to forget once watched. This film is an influential film that is capable of changing how we see reality and life. It's about an extraordinary English teacher named John Keating, who uses unique ways through literature and poetry, to teach his students about life. He once said in the film, ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering  these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love  these are what we stay alive for."" The film was opened in a well known prestigious Welton Academy which was an all-boys prep school. The school was popular for its four principles: tradition, honor, discipline and excellence. There was a group of friends which was consisted of: Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks and Gerard Pitts.

Neil Perry was a student that excelled in many subjects in school. He did everything that his father wanted him to do. When Mr. Keating told him to seize the day and to live an extraordinary life, he defied his father's wishes. He followed his dream, acting on stage, which was not approved by his father. He was pulled out of the school. He wanted to tell his father his own decisions but, he did not succeed and opted to commit suicide using his father's gun.

Todd Anderson was a shy boy. He had an older brother who also studied on the same school. That's why he needed to live up to his reputation. He also thought that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. Mr. Keating proved him wrong, he told him that he knew that something inside him was worth a great deal. And from that day on, his life was heavily influenced and changed.

Knox Overstreet was a persistent guy. He met a girl named Chris and instantly fell in love with her. He desired to see her after their first encounter. Later on, he realized that Chris already had a boyfriend. Yet he persisted in courting her. He didn't care if he gets punched or humiliated. He used poetry in wooing Chris. He even said ""She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. Carpe diem. Even if it kills me."" Charlie Dalton was a rebel and a dare devil. He did anything that pleased him. He once took his personal freedom too far and published an article that proposed girls to be allowed at Welton to give the boys some pleasure. The authorities learnt of it and interrogated Charlie. Charlie told them that he acted alone. Later in the story, he changed his name to Newanda.

John Keating is an extraordinary teacher. He used unusual teaching methods that any other ordinary teachers won't approve of. He taught outside the classroom, tried different approaches and ensured that it was not boring. He hated the idea of learning literature by doing scales of quality and popularity ratings. Instead, he ensured that his students learned to stretch their minds, to think for themselves and to exercise their own rights to defy acts of love for literature and life. He simply was a one of a kind and an amazing teacher.

One of the things that John Keating emphasized was ""Carpe Diem"" which meant seize the day, make your lives extraordinary. He showed his students a picture of former Welton students in a trophy case. He explained that they were once like them. Each one of them was full of their own hopes and dreams. Only they themselves knew if they made their lives extraordinary since these alumni are now dead.

This made the group of friends revive an old literary club called the Dead Poets Society. Neil Perry once read ""I went to the woods to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, and not when I came to die, that I had not lived."" This simply tells us that being a member of the Dead Poets Society meant that they have decided that they won't be held as captives by their fathers or anyone else anymore. They will decide on their own and do thing that they want to do. Nobody can stop them, not even death. What matters is that they followed their own paths. This would be the only way for them to experience everything that life has to offer; everything that they had not experienced when they were enslaved from their parent's expectations and other people's standards. And when death swallows them up, they can say that they had truly lived an extraordinary life. They had seized the days.",10
VERY DRAMATIC FILM,"this film makes me cry,lots of dramatic dialogue and moments in this film.this film is fit to plays in schools because this film very educate the students to always take the opportunities in life",10
A Wonderful Film with a Great Anti-Conformity Message,"A thoughtful, moving, uplifting film, Dead Poets Society is about a teacher's relationship with his students, and how he helped them to grow and have a better quality of life through poetry.

The performances were mostly strong all around, with the central characters being surprisingly solid and well-fleshed out for such young actors. The camaraderie between the boys was nice and believable, I thought they portrayed their friendship realistically. Robin Williams steals the show in every scene he's in, and I don't think he ever got his due as a dramatic actor. Sure he's a great comedy actor, but this and Good Will Hunting (1997) cement his obvious dramatic talent for any doubters. He too is believable in his role, and he develops a believable relationship with his students.

Is Peter Weir not one of the greatest directors out there? He has such a good body of work, and his dramatic style and look are ever present here. I can't quite describe the feel of his films, but it's there. If you enjoyed or of the World, than you'll appreciate this effort from Weir. It may be his best film.

The movie's message and philosophy are admirable, too. The goal of taking every moment and living life instead of letting time slip away is important, and the emotional story surrounding the teacher's relationship with his students and how if affected their relationships is also moving and well-structured. The aspect of people being brought closer together through art and an appreciation of it is also interesting. Some may argue that non-conformity was the message, and that the film's ending goes against that, but I think non-conformity and defending one's own beliefs was displayed in the ending, and non-conformity is only part of the overall point anyway.

I definitely can recommend this, though many have seen it already anyway. It's definitely one of Williams' best performances, and Weir's best films. If you ever needed inspiration to read poetry, this is the best place to start.",10
Dead Poet's Society....,"This movie is a must see! Great movie about a group of boys who find their true inner-selves in the mist of an upper-class school. Robin Williams really pulls this part off as a teacher who helps guide the boys to what will forever be something they will cherish the rest of their lives. I have to say that this movie really taught myself a few life lessons with, ""suck the marrow out of life."" The ending really leaves a mark on your heart and a tear in your eye. If you love movies that keep you thinking and at the edge of your seat yet entertaining at the same time, this is the movie for you. This movie really does teach many life lessons that people of all ages should learn.",10
Life is not that simple,"People who choose a different path from others, although feeling lonely or even incurring discrimination, do not mean that it is a fault - on the contrary, a real hero often chooses a path that few people will take. People are desperate in peace",9
Robin Williams continues to teach us,"This film was one of the career highlights for Robin Williams and I can see why.

This film gives him the opportunity to show off all the colours of that talent, he can be funny, he can be sentimental and in his role as Keating can make you laugh and cry in equal measure.

A lot of credit has to go to director Peter Weir who gets such engaging performances from the young actors playing the boys at the school and also for channelling such a layered performance from Williams.

I think though while the film is good it is slow paced at times and there are too many short scenes that don't really add to the piece. However,what makes up for that is the heart and message behind the film, and they are the reason that it is held in such high esteem by everyone who sees it.",6
This movie hasn't aged well,"Well, I remember loving this movie when I first saw it 15 years ago in junior high, but perhaps the film's main theme of a young, convention-defying teacher challenging kids to think freely and ""seize the day"" (an injunction that was repeated ad nauseum, even by a kid who used it as justification for molesting a passed-out girl) has been mimicked so many times that it just isn't novel anymore. More than that, however, the film has a number of inherent flaws.

Williams plays Keating, an English professor who has just arrived at a prep school run by an authoritarian type who is hell-bent on adhering to the institution's guiding principles of tradition and discipline. Williams literally appears to be the only teacher at the school under the age of 95. Williams throws around a lot of quotes, but the full context and meaning of the quotes or the poems from which they are plundered are never explored but are rather exploited to make a cheap point. Whitman's ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"" is invoked merely b/c Keating wants the students to call him that. At one point Keating gets in an argument with an older teacher who questions his teaching methods, and both engage in a competition of trading quotes from poems. Have any two people in the entire history of humankind ever argued like this? Just curious.

So what are these teaching methods that have the school's elders so worried? Well, most of Keating's classes seem to take place outside. He has the students do things like walk around in a courtyard (so they can ""choose their own direction"") or recite poems while kicking a ball. He also has them stand up on desks. Keating is apparently a rugby coach as well. At least, I am assuming this, because of the shot in which the kids are playing rugby and Keating is running along the sidelines like an idiot with his hands over his head. Keating doesn't care for textbooks, having students tear out the introduction to a textbook in which it is claimed that poems can be judged on two dimensions and then plotted on an axis. Did such textbooks actually exist back then? What poetry scholar would make such a ridiculous claim? It just seemed as if the filmmakers were setting up a straw man that Keating's character could knock down.

Williams does a decent job with the script that he has to work with. The young actors who played the students were also decent, including a young Ethan Hawke. All of the other characters, who include the school principle, as well as the parents of one of the kids who kills himself, are one dimensional caricatures. This kid kills himself because his domineering father won't permit him to act; such frivolous extracurricular activities, the father claims, will interfere with the father's intentions to send his kid to Harvard to become a doctor. Okay, I had one question. Even assuming that the father sees the fine arts as a distraction from more practical concerns, why in the hell would acting in a play hurt his son's chances of going to Harvard? Don't schools value extracurricular activities? In any case, the father's opposition to his son's acting ambitions is wholly disproportionate, as is the son's failure to realize that once he is in college he will be more independent.

Overall, I think that this film had something to say before the emergence of alternative teaching styles, but it just seems incredibly outdated now.",4
Carpe Diem: Seize The Day!,"Not only will this movie touch your heart and possibly bring tears to your eyes, it will inspire you to be a better mentor to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries or consequences may be. It is truly poetry on the screen.. a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges. The thought of non conformity scares a lot of people in this world but when you choose to take a step out of the box your life will forever be changed. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do. The film does portray a great deal of tragic irony but I wont be a spoiler. This movie has defiantly taken my love of poetry to an entirely new level!",9
A very touching piece of art!,"I literally adore the movie. My most favourite one. It spread messages about free will, being authentic to yourself and following your heart and your individual path and the value and power of desire. All these through the stories of some teenage boys.",10
Oh Robin my captain....,"Wonderful movie made me long to be back at school being taught by Mr Keating, reliving those wasted years. That ending...oh, that ending....stays in your mind long after the credits and beautiful music has ended. Thank you Robin, thank you.",9
Goodbye Mr. Quips,"This cloyingly overlong prep school based drama about a teacher thinking outside the box in 50s America and a mix of conflicted dullards he influenced to literally new heights with tragic consequence seems to meander more than build. When it finally does at nearly two hours grasp some intensity it does so by a quick fix deus ex machina.

Newly arrived John Keating ( Robin Williams) roars into his first year at the staid Welton Academy with some unorthodox ideas. A former student himself he encourages the lads to reform the Dead Poet's Society and seize the day. It all seems rather odd that having gone to the school and understood its highly conservative motto he might take it kind of slow in his first year but hey, no one's gonna get in the way of Robin doing his routine.

Williams is mawkishly idealistic, less zany more zen. Only he could commit an act of Fascist book burning and make it seem nobly liberating. His students are more or less relegated to looking upon him in awe addressing him in hushed tones. Norman Lloyd as the headmaster chews up more than one desk.

Peter Weir's direction lingers rather than soar and the film never achieves much trajectory, just plods in mostly morose adolescent funk. John Searles cinematography is town and country and Maurice Jarrre's music score flush with pompous importance. Dead Poet's Society may not be dead on arrival but it's in critical condition most of the way.",6
Best Movie of All Time,"This movie came out during my second year of University. Although I was a business major, the Carpe Diem theme resonated so strongly with me that it has shaped my life. I am not sure Dead Poets would have the same impact if I saw it at any other time in my life, but my identification with the main characters (group of young men living in a dorm) drew me into the movie. After watching this movie, I had an unquenchable thirst for Emerson, Thoreau (Walden is amazing) and the other Transcendentalists. This is more than a movie - it is a philosophy that can shape a very meaningful life. I watch Dead Poets Society every so often to reconnect with the younger version of myself - when possibilities were limitless and youthful idealism governed my actions.

I am in my early 40's now and am passing on the Carpe Diem message to my 3 daughters.",10
Extremely Overrated!,"""To Sir, with Love"" it is not! Dont expect the world, and maybe..just maybe you wont be disappointed. Maurice Jarre's (Dr.Zhivago) compositions are top notch as always. Ethan Hawke, Robin Williams et al have put in fine performances, but it isn't enough to make this a gripping tale.

It is (story line) pretty loose-ended and flimsy. And the ending isnt great either. It is in fact an anti climax! The high ratings for this film are unfounded. Mass Hysteria u may call it! :-)",6
The best of the best,"Dead Poets Society is the best movie I have ever seen of the drama kind,it has everything to make an excellent movie. Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and all the guys play an excellent role. The movie makes you think about life and what we lost when we're under so many rules and repression.",10
Carpe diem! A sad melancholy.,"One of the few films I would like to watch over and over again and it was a tumultuous experience to me. This movie perfectly portrayed modern vision of our society. Always follow your instinct, show you who you are, prove it with passion, courage. Life is a race if you halt, people will leap forward you. But what's the point of leading a race when you can't suck the marrow out of your life. Robin Williams always wished to be a teacher like this in his school life and he didn't let down. This journey felt like the true visual representation of Dead Poets Society!",10
CARPE DIEM!,"Masterpiece.

The acting game was amazing, the cinematography was gorgeous and the storyline was brilliant. That's a movie everyone should watch because the message that it spreads is so important - free will, being true to yourself and following your individual path and heart. Movies like this make me wish I had a travel machine so I could turn back time and watch Dead Poets Society again so I can feel like the first time I saw it.",9
Inspiring,"I recently saw the movie. Its meaning is still timeless, and produces strong emotions. Follow your dreams, passions, and, goals, be ambitious, keep trying and never stop believing in pure values and standards. It means a lot to have someone in your life to teach you this valuable lesson. For me it was a professor as well. So the movie did affect me a lot.

It's sad though that it still captures today's society. Things haven't really changed. The necessity of expressing feelings is of high importance and can affect one's life. People still can't talk to their parents and seek mentors and advisors elsewhere, but the void is never filled. The educational system hasn't changed either. Education is more than just doing maths and physics. It's about creating character, find yourself and developing ideas. That's why students fadmire professors like Keating. They become more like mentors and their words stay with you forever.

Great movie, teaches valueble lessons.",9
Attempt at inspiration feels preachy,"This film is clearly attempting to be as inspirational as its teacher Mr. Keating. Using unconventional methods and a sense of self-confidence, Dead Poets Society/Mr. Keating aims to rouse us into being non-conformist and achieving our true selves. The problem is that it becomes endlessly preachy and repetitive, turning the characters into ready-made roles instead of real human beings. Mr. Keating is too good for this earth, the students are impressionable and roused to action, one student is shy but has his potential unlocked, another student falls into the trap of conformism and the school administration exists just to be villainous. On a scene-to-scene basis, the characters seem fleshed out and compelling, which made the story quite enjoyable to watch, but overall they just fit into standard storytelling slots, so by the end it didn't feel genuine. At least it had some nuance - the pranks and flirting really didn't go anywhere and Mr. Keating didn't keep his job - showing the imperfections of the lessons.",7
starts slow but worthwhile,"Unorthodox teacher inspires students at staid 50's boarding school. Intelligent, starts slowly but is generally quite good.",7
Inspiring drama that evokes memories of learning and self-discovery,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a maturing into adulthood drama whose story and messages are as instructional as they are inspiring. The film is like an inspirational teacher, the one in high school that changed the way you thought about life and knowledge. It reflects this in Mr. Keating, the teacher who touched the lives of a group of teenage boys for the better despite the monstrous obstacle of conformity in all their paths.

Directed by Peter Weir (""Gallipoli"") and written beautifully by Tom Schulman, ""Dead Poets Society"" stars Robin Williams in one his first great dramatic performances as Keating, an English teacher at an all-boys boarding school who inspires his students with poetry and by encourages their own free thinking with the simple motto of ""carpe diem (seize the day).""

But the film is really about the boys and their various struggles. Todd (Ethan Hawke) is quiet and keeps to himself -- he's scared of personal expression. Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) is living in the iron grip of his father (Kurtwood Smith) who insists he become a doctor when his passion is really acting. Knox (Josh Charles) discovers infatuation/love and the courage it requires and Charlie deals the barriers of free speech. Keating's lessons inspire their actions and bring out new parts of themselves and together they hold Dead Poets Society meetings in a cave in the woods.

The clique of rebellious teenage boys and their unusual teacher are not motifs foreign to film, and neither are themes of fighting conformity and making the most of life. Most adults know all about these ideas -- they're not exactly profound and original -- but Tom Schulman tells ""Dead Poets Society"" in such a way that allows you to rediscover them and reawaken memories of what that personal experience was like. We see the rigid culture and system of the school and the classroom and then suddenly Keating comes in and makes learning what it should be. Suddenly we remember who our ""Keatings"" were and what it was like when we finally learned the value of our own perspectives, ideas and most importantly, desires.

The cast of young men is excellent. They make sure no character entirely falls into a teenage stereotype despite their many personalities that make up the group dynamic. We remember our own youthful enthusiasm through their experience and empathize with their troubles.

Weir's direction leads us gracefully into this rediscovery. His use of symbolism and the subtle ways he re-implants elements of the classroom scenes into the students' subplots and other key moments of the film draw us back to the power of the learning experience and how it can leave such a fine imprint on our lives. We see clearly how those scenes with Keating give life to the rest of the story and rekindle our memories and ignite our emotions as we connect to the characters and their experiences.

""Dead Poets Society"" is a great execution of a simple inspirational drama/tragedy. Despite having all the elements, it avoids cliché much of the time or at least masks it with the strong connection the story builds with its audience. Many films have been more dramatic or original, but this film really gets the most out of what it is and tells a story about something universally human to which every soul with even the slightest meaningful education experience can relate. ~Steven C

Quite dull. I don't get the love.,"The only Best Picture nominee from 1989 that I hadn't yet seen. It was a real bad year for the Oscars, I think. Of the five, I like Born on the Fourth of July a lot. Or at least I used to like it. I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to ""carpe diem,"" or ""sieze the day."" The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance.",5
Excellent Robin Williams film,"DEAD POETS SOCIETY, in my opinion, is an excellent Robin Williams film. Despite the fact that Keating (Robin Williams) was funny, his antics were a little unorthodox. The first time I ever saw this was in English class during my senior year of high school. After seeing it then, I decided I liked it. However, I didn't buy it on VHS until a year or so later. If you ask me, the most memorable quote is, ""Carpe Diem!"" In case you're wondering, that's a Latin phrase. Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Robin Williams or Ethan Hawke, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today.",9
"Sad, though quite inspirational","I generally find great inspiration in films like this, and ""Dead Poets Society"" is no exception. Robin Williams stars as a professor who encourages his students to ""make your lives extraordinary."" This ends up causing some of the students to go too far in this direction, resulting in the ""sad"" elements of this film. I did, however, feel a sense of encouragement in what Williams says, realizing that we've only got one life in this world and should make it something great. The scenes with Williams are superb, some of the best dialogue you will ever hear, in this film that won an Oscar for its screenplay. Williams was robbed of an Oscar here, though he later won one for the similar film he appeared in ""Good Will Hunting."" Though I like ""Good Will Hunting"" even better, I truly enjoyed this film. The one thing I felt it lacked was enough scenes with Williams and his students. Too many scenes feature the students off on their own in their club, or getting in trouble with other students or their parents, scenes that can get depressing when there are so many of them. Fortunately, Robin Williams comes around often enough the lighten things up a bit, though this is considered one of the first of his more serious roles. The ending scene is great, as is the one with Williams telling the students to rip out part of their textbook. A nicely-done, inspiring film. Not perfect, though it is still quite good.

one of the greatest I've ever seen,"i was really fascinated by this one.it's heart-lifting and if you haven't seen it you should definitely work out the problem-you've missed a lot.i do think that this film may change your life.everything here is just great:the cast,the plot,the level of acting and at last,but not least the strong affection on your mind and aims.as i saw there are so many comments on this that i think mine is not necessary,but i felt like i'm very concerned and obliged to write something,so,i thought that i can be useful ,just as many here in the site. Honestly,i was looking for some info for my essay in English about this film,but now i'm really keen on saying'Seiz the day'. wish all of you who have read this luck.that's all,and please don't tell me that you are bored of me!Jeez,thanks!:)",9
"""Carpe Diem, Make your lives incredible""","Dead Poets Society powerfully captures the stereotypical 1950s' attitudes towards parental guidance, education and life in general. Incredible film techniques and subtle character development makes Dead Poets Society a truly amazing film. The protagonists Mr Keating, Neil Perry, Todd Anderson really make the film what it is and have amazing depth. Dead Poets Society is an unmissable film and is unparalleled in 'watchability': whether its your first time watching or your ninety-first, it always leaves tingles running down your spine the hairs on the back of your neck standing and goosebumps cascading down your body...",10
"Somewhere between ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Patch Adams""...","I notice that Robin Williams often plays a free-spirited neophyte who introduces a new modus operandi, and his superiors try to stop him. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Patch Adams"" are the two obvious examples, but ""Dead Poets Society"" is another (maybe even ""Awakenings"" fits into this category). In this one, he plays English professor John Keating, who teaches his students a new way of looking at everything in an Ivy League school in 1959.

When I first saw this, I noticed that it starred the dad from ""That '70s Show"", and from this movie I learned that his name is Kurtwood Smith. Also starring are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. I've never seen a Peter Weir movie that I didn't like, and this affirms that list. Maybe it won't change how you view the world, but you're sure to like what Robin Williams makes everyone do with their textbooks.",7
A wonderful movie,"I know a lot of the people who gave this a low rating are teenagers who watched this in English class, but I was told by my English teacher to go out and watch this movie, and when I saw it on TV the other night, I started watching.

This is, I can honestly say, one of the best movies I have ever seen in my short 15 years. It was beautifully done, and very inspiring to watch. I am so thankful for the recommendation. The plot was captivating, and I was completely mesmerized. I am a huge fan of the show House, and seeing Robert Sean Leonard in one of his earlier acting careers only made me love him more; his character was wonderfully portrayed. Robin Williams' character was equally great to watch.

Someone advised teachers not to make their students watch this movie, and I think that that's a shame; but probably true. There are probably only like, four kids who will take the movie seriously and understand the depth of it, while the rest will sit around make jokes about it all day...",10
Oscar bait,"Felt like Oscar bait to me. Robin Williams is playing ""cool teacher"", the guy who's supposed to be funny in the world of the movie. I didn't find him nearly as funny as his fellow characters, which created a big divide between me and the characters. This is a big problem in media, when a character is supposed to be a funny guy but the viewer does not see it that way. That's probably the main reason that so many people hate on Seinfeld, because they can't relate to the logic of a world in which Jerry's jokes all land.

Another problem is the poetry references and shoehorned motivations. I did not feel a shred of connection to the kid who looked like Jim Carrey, and he is a crucial sympathetic character. I just couldn't buy his motivation.

I did not give a cum about any of the other boys aside to Charlie. Cameron, Todd, Knox, they were all forgettable and unimportant.

This movie gets a 6 because the end was strong, and the death was ballsy. Robin Williams is charming, even if he isn't very funny here. Oscar bait doesn't taste good, but it also doesn't deserve a terrible review. This movie is slightly above average.",6
A classic movie yet so subtle,"The poets society is one of the finest movies you will come across specially if you are a student and have dreams John Keating a progressive English teacher gets appointed in strict 50s school and teaches the students about life in his unorthodox poetic way. He encourage his students to break free from the norm, go against the status quo and live life unapologetically In John Keating's words Carpe Diem",9
Brilliant Piece,"This movie, for one, is a real gem of character fruition. Set in the fictional Welton (Hell-ton) Academy for Boys we follow a few of its students and a new English teacher, Mr. Keating. One of the main themes, as propelled by Mr. Keating to the boys, is to grasp life as it is and not as it's expected and he does that through embedding an appreciation for poetry and the literary arts- not as mere text to adhere and memorize but as emotions and stories to feel. Through that Mr. Keating allowed the boys to get to know themselves and find where their passion lies, aside from what is expected of their future.

One of the main characters, Neil Perry, may have been the most influenced by this new perspective being taught and goes about to form a bastard version of the Dead Poets Society upon learning of it from Mr. Keating's past as a former student of Welton. This ushers in a flurry of self-discovery and adolescent rebellion as the boys find themselves building an appreciation for the arts and self-expression.

The villain of the movie lay with the school officials and some parents garnering the uppity appeal of authority and the 'right way' of things. The inevitable struggle with that and the boys was an awesome display of humanity as the Dead Poets Society is inevitably dismantled because of a tragic resolution of one of the characters. The process showed how selfish people can be in the face of doing the right thing as opposed to not getting chided for your own beliefs. The way it reflected how society conditions and discourages free-thinking is awesome, especially when the caged-bird syndrome is revealed with Neil Perry.

The acting in this movie, considering the ages of the characters was great. All the little nuances that you would expect from a group of teenage boys were there and they were, surprisingly, tolerable. We got to see a young Ethan Hawke, as Todd Anderson, flap his acting wings as the film's strong under-dog supporting character. The direction was great as well. The mood and the overall growth of the film was enough to put you into the world and root for the characters while not being too demanding or too taxing on the viewer. Robin Williams excelled in the dramatics of his role and it was a breath of fresh air to see him go to his comedic panache in the few moments that he did. Being a teen movie one would expect some elements of a love scene and it was there but not in the overwhelming sense for it to take away from the film, it merely supplemented the appreciation for passion and seizing the day – as was the general theme of the movie.

It's indeed a classic in its own right and one that should be watched at least once to make your life extraordinary. The life lessons scattered throughout will leave you feeling, somewhat, appreciative of the little things and will leave you chanting Carpe Diem or referring to a friend as 'Captain, My Captain.'

Standout Line: ""We don't read & write poetry because it's cute. We read & write poetry because we're human beings and we're filled with passion!""",8
"Free Thinker, Fence. or Follower?","I just saw this movie in my band class because of testing and I can't believe I never heard of it before. This film has a great cast and right. People shouldn't have to go along with everybody if they have different dreams of their own. Neil, one the Free Thinker at school but Follower and home, wanted to become an actor but his jealous and controlling father gave him no other option. Todd, my favorite and a Fencer, isn't sure whether he wants to go along with what everybody is doing instead of following his heart and he is jealous of his friend Neil because he has trouble speaking in front of people and has a low self esteem. Yes, Cameron is a Follower who goes by the rules no matter what. The ruler he used to tear off the pages of his book is an example that he only goes by the rules and never bends them only if someone asks him to. Mr. Keening is my favorite character because he interacts with his students in such an effective way that gets them interested in the class. And the comments he says sometimes are just plain hilarious. I just like the overall message about Siezing the Day and that we are all worm food so why live our life according to how others want us to live them? We all like different passions and dislikes and shouldn't feel afraid to get out of our little fence of protection, safety, isolation, fear, or security. We must come out of our comfort zones to fully live. Being Alive is not just breathing and moving, it's living for what we believe in and acting on those beliefs accordingly. That is when we will truly make a difference.",10
"Familiar style, different content, amazing film","Without a doubt, this is my favorite film of all time! No other film has inspired me, challenged me, or changed me as much as this film! It takes a simple idea of making the most out of everyday and expands it to the nth degree, all the while reaching across to audiences of many kinds, from film critics to moviegoers to high school students to even Academy members! It talks about seizing the day, your life, and getting the most out of it, which is what you would expect. But it delves much deeper, revealing the challenges of seizing your life, especially growing up, the pressure on how you should live and on how you should follow, and the potential consequences of doing so. Yet at the same time, it shows you the benefits and how those benefits greatly outweigh those negative traits. And it does so in such an intriguing way. Each kid is different and well-developed yet all have some similarity. Robin Williams plays an amazing role as Mr. Keating (I always saw him as a more talented dramatic actor than a comedic one). Some have said that the story is unrealistic and a rehash of other student- teacher movies. But like the poetry in this movie, this is not about realism, this is about the message of seizing the day and making your world extraordinary. The way the movie does this is so unforgettable with the believable and grade-A acting from the students and Williams, the great camera shots, and the amazing theme and atmosphere, so much so that I can watch the entire movie just for those select scenes. All of this and more is why Dead Poets Society is my number 1 favorite movie of all time!",10
Lifestyle change,"This film really has moved my general opinion of life. Great actors' work and what a message to give! The first time I saw the film ""Dead Poets Society"" was as a school project, and I became rather interested in the concept, nothing more at the time. I delivered my paper and thought nothing of the film until it was on television 2 years later. Now, during these years, I had practically done nothing with my life and was kind of depressed but as I saw this movie again, I was astonished. I cried at the end etc. etc. and really went into a big think. The next couple of weeks, I did some ""wild"" things to just feel that I was living, and I actually began acting, got a tattoo on my arm that says ""Carpe Diem"" to remember me of my duty to get the best of life, and to get that today, and every day. To never count on tomorrow. Since I saw that movie, I have had nightmares of me lying as a 85 year old man, ready to die, thinking ""man, what have i actually done with my life. It's too late to do something about it now"". Anyway, no matter how you live your lives, I respect it, as long as you do, just what you really want to do :) Carpe Diem everyone",10
It's so bad,"The concept in itself is great ,but the plot in the movie is so thin that you can see the uselessness behind it,it's main goal is to defy the normal,and I quote'""seize the day"" but ironically all the movie is showing otherwise,and the ending is so cheesy ,like comeone ,it started really well but seriously we r not 12 here",6
What a Screenplay !,"This movie won Oscar for the Best original screenplay, it really worths it. Peter Weir's teenage heartwarming drama, featuring Robin Williams as Mr. Keating in the lead character who is a teacher but his ways teaching are extraordinary and which made his student's life extraordinary. This Film can be called as the inspiration for the new adolescent dramas even yhe bollywood films like Taare zameen par and 3 idiots has the glimpse of this film, but what makes this movie different is the ending which contains the reality. The cinematography and production design was stunning and nowadays students can understand how the education system and the ways of enjoyments were at that time for the 70s born. Really Loved the film.",9
Good probably overhyped - Good Robin Williams aura movie,"Great performance of Robert Williams (RIP), although it makes me wander why he's always a professor or a mentor, think Good will Hunting and Jumanji. Great performance nonetheless. One thing that hasn't aged great is that this is about the life of mostly rich white prep kids in new England. Other than that, solid movie, I was expecting a little more given the hype. Terrible style in the 80's. Movie a little too corny/ black and white. Robert Sean Leonard 'got the short end of the stick when we reflect on his career, I guess he's doing good in the theater.",6
Absolutely Unconvincing,"How can anyone feel moved by DEAD POET`S SOCIETY ? It`s got to be one of the most overrated and sugar coated films ever made . I`ve seen more reality in LORD OF THE RINGS

First up is the rich kids schoolboy characters . Come on surely they are amongst the most unlikable people on Earth . Fortunate , spoiled rotten , dripping with money and who let the world and his wife know it , nothing about the boys here rings true . The strongest thing they put in a pipe is hand rolling tobacco ? Yeah right .

Secondly there`s the teachers . I know I can speak for all of us when I say there were certain teachers at school who made our lives a total misery , you know the ones I`m talking about , they make the gestapo look like social workers and whose only function in life was to show us that injustice and sadistic cruelty do indeed exist in a democratic country . I guess that DEAD POET`S SOCIETY tries to make that point too but it fails . The "" bad "" teachers here are shown as being stuffy disciplinarians who do everything by the book but there`s no one here that you can describe as being the worst nightmare of your own schooldays

And has this film got anything against Shakespere ? FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING feels it might have been written and acted ( Especially by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean ) in a Shakespere style . DEAD POET`S SOCIETY most certainly isn`t , so why does the film put the boot into the great bard ?

DEAD POET`S SOCIETY isn`t an awful film , but neither is a great one . It`s spoiled by an infusion of sentimentality at the expense of reality . I do concede that Williams is rather good in the role of John Keating , performed at a time when he was known only as a manic comedy actor , but Williams alone isn`t really enough to hold your attention in a film that feels overlong",5
Dead Poets Society - One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time...,Dead Poets Society is a masterpiece in all aspects... Robin Williams and the young cast did a fantastic job... The acting and the screenplay is what that makes this movie so good.. The soundtrack is pretty good. Dead Poets Society is a life changing movie and everyone should watch this movie once before dying.,10
"Oh Captain, My Captain.","Long before I had seen this film I knew of the most famous scene, that being the ""Oh, captain, my captain"" scene, and I've seen the phrase 'Carpe Diem' scribbled on whiteboards ever since I was a wee little lad in grade school. This film was ingrained in our culture before I entered the world (I know, I'm so young!), so I've never known a world without the ideas presented by so brilliantly and succinctly by John Keating (Robin Williams, ""The Fisher King""). If I had seen this film probably ten years ago, during the days of my youth when I was still searching for authors who could better put into words how I felt about the world, this film probably would've been a five star movie for me, but now, in the post-#Me Too era there are a few issues that come to light, and I also found there was a bit too much melodrama in the third act for my taste.

As a whole however, this film is a wonderful work of art that has themes that I so agree with that I could sing about them from the top of a mountain. I've often quoted Franz Kafka on the TMM Podcast, specifically one of his more famous quotes, which is: ""A book must be an axe for the frozen sea inside us,"" meaning that good fiction should chip away at us, soften us, make us reconsider our own thoughts and ideas... I think that the same quote could be ascribed to films as well (or any art form, for that matter). Great films challenge me, and this film tries its darndest to do just that. I think this film that, thirty years after its release, just falls short of being Peter Weir's masterpiece (you just can't beat ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", in my opinion).",8
Great film!,"This is one of my all time faves.

All the cast is excellent

In this film I laughed, I cried and I watched with anticipation.

I have only seen this film five times but I am still waiting for it to be on again.

I believe that Williams played an excellent role and it made me surprised how he could play a kind, funny and tearjearking role after parts in comedy. I also believe that Ethan played an excellent role to as the quite passive pupil. He played an exceptional duo with Williams and I hope to see more films like this as it really brought new light to my eyes of films

We need more films of this caliber out there.",10
"The best Robbin Williams acting, an Oscar he did not win","This extraordinary movie, with excelent cinematography, is one of my favorites. The inspiring story about a revolutionary teacher in the early sixties, who take his students into the world of thinking, instead of the world of memorizing rules. The truth shall make you free. Carpe Diem, Seize the day, the phrase that became popular with this movie. Carpe Diem, a latin phrase which means to live our days as if they were the last ones, living fully, plenty of joy. Looking for our dreams and get them, it does not matter what the world says, if we want them, we will achieve them. Carpe Diem.

Robin Williams In One Of His Best,"A new English instructor comes to the prestigious boys prep school, The Welton Academy, where standards are high and discipline is an integral part of the curriculum. John Keating (Robin Williams) studied at Welton himself as a boy, and he is looking to inspire his students by asking them to think outside the box and to prioritize expression above achievement. Using poetry, he challenges them to find their artistic voices, but he may be too free-thinking for the stuffy boarding school that is so proud of its traditions.

Robin Williams plays this part so well. In fact, I would have preferred that he was onscreen more. The actors who play the students are well cast. Special mention goes to Kurtwood Smith (who played Red in ""That 70s Show""); as father of one student, he has a meaty role that dominates the screen.

Among the best films about teachers, ""Dead Poets Society"" ranks highly.",7
So much more,"Something this page doesn't inform you about Dead Poet's Society is the astute use of little-known or unknown actors and their top notch performances or the fact that it received four nominations at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

Robin Williams used this film as a vehicle for serious acting rather than the comedic roles and stand-up he was so popular for and he did a masterful job. Anybody that thinks it's easy for someone to go from comedy into serious roles ought to take a good look at this film if they haven't.",10
An absolute delight!,"Upon watching Dead Poets Society, I was truly touched - tears were brought to my eyes with the heart rendering tale of friendship, coming of age, death and loss. Robin Williams cements this film with his portrayal of John Keating, an inspirational English teacher who invokes his students to seize the day and live life, however within the confines of a strict conservative elitist academy - which bodes well for the adversarial route that emerges between Keating and the Institution. In short, it was truly wonderful, OK it's not raw and brimming with realism, however this is not what this film attempts to do - a pure gem with a fantastic cast, I would definitely recommend it.",9
A brilliant performance by Robin Williams,"Central in ""Dead poets society"" is the Welton academy. A high school for the rich and very rich that is supposed to prepare his pupils for renowned universities like Yale and Harvard. In this proces a teacher putting emphasis on independent thinking is not very welcome. John Keating (Robin Williams in a brilliant performance) is such a teacher, loved by his pupils, hated by the management of the school. In this sense ""Dead poets society""tells two stories. The story of the relationship between Keating and the management and the story of the relationship between Keating and his pupils.

From the story of the relationship between Keating and the management we learn that the management is not the ""bad guy"", at any rate not the ultimate ""bad guy"". What the management is doing is in fact in accordance with the wishes of the parents. At the end of the day it is mainly the parents who want their children to learn well without asking critical questions.

The relationship between Keating and his pupils is more complicated and I think the film gives a rather one-sided picture of this relationship. Are his pupils really interested in poetry or more in rebellion and adventure? Do the ""followers"" of Keating reallu think independently or is a new form of group think evolving?",7
"Entertaining, if you like heavy melodrama with little substance.","After all the hoopla, what really happens in this movie? One kid kills himself, a teacher loses his job, and the system remains the same. Why does the kid shoot himself? Because he has a stock character of a dad that doesn't understand his son's desire to wear tights and spout poetry. What is a lad to do? Try and really stand up to dad? No. Try and talk to mom or another sympathetic ear that might be able to sway dad? No. Run away from home until dad realizes he made a mistake? No... wait, I got it: Blow your own skull off! And what about the lad's mentor? The teacher who dared to defy the system and take the fall? All the desk stomping and Shakespearean one-liners didn't save his job or reputation in the end. He leaves and the system wins again. So did anything really change in this movie? Doesn't really seem that way. A couple kids were more ""enlightened"" I guess. But how? Ethan Hawke, whom I presume is the protagonist, watches his one pal kill himself in an act of cowardly selfishness, and his star teacher get crushed by the bureaucracy.

This film was moving when I was in high school, but later viewings made me feel as if I'd been had. The film seemed to work for many people though. ""Oh Captain, My Captain"" was the equivalent of the filmmakers saying, ""Cry, audience people! Cry!"". It certainly is affective among the those ""poor"", ""misunderstood"" souls, as I felt when I was 14. Fortunately now, I know better.",5
Robin is Legend,Amazing extraordinary movie...must watch...RIP ROBIN,10
Life Changing Experience,"This film is especially to be seen by young people around the ages of 13 to 17, I'm sure for most of them the movie will be the turning point of their lives and it will let them gain a different perspective.

Generally I can say that the movie touched me, and still touches me every time I see it. A must see for everyone..

For those who wish to have an idea about the story; The movie brings the lives of young high school students into your hearts and you feel the uniqueness and different qualities of each person(make projections to your own social environment. These children are studying in one of the ""best"" schools in the country, which strictly relies on traditional education methods but their life starts to change and their identities to vivified when a new teacher, Mr Keating who is a former graduate from the same school, starts lecturing there.. The rest is for everyone's taste and I can assure you that no matter who you are or where you live, you will find something from yourself in this movie. Don't miss it.",10
intense viewing for anyone in South Korea,"This was the first time I watch this movie. I will probably see this movie again. I recommend this movie to people in Korea because it's relevant in Korea's high pressure education system. The movie is a good antidote to the conformism in Korea. I'm sure young students like myself will find the movie quite inspiring.

Apart from the fact that it resonated with my own situation I can also say the acting is superb and the plot gripping.

It struck me too that the language in the movie is very engaging and encouraging for someone like me - a non-native speaker to go on developing my English skills.",10
Live poets society!,"Ah! This movie is grand. A movie which can wake you up, change your way of thinking and encourage you to be yourself. To think for yourself and by yourself and do not let anyone do it on your behalf. Carpe diem..",10
Important film that everybody should watch,"The film chooses aspects of life that are forever important and meaningful. The way Robbie Williams portraits the teacher is not what I expected but in the end it makes sense. The director shows us the problems and struggles of life including: having your own opinion, being free and happy. The theme of poetry makes the movie beautiful and philosophical. I love movies that make you thing and reflect upon life. With this movie, you can stop and talk for hours with your wife/husband about suicide, death, non conformism, teaching, sexism and so many other interesting topics. Please watch and enjoy.",7
Blubbed like a Big Baby...,"I was told before going to see Dead Poet's Society that it could be quite an emotional film with many saying that they cried as they watched it.

So I went and watched. Some very emotional stuff, but I never felt close to tears...

Until the end. The final scene of the film is truly, truly wonderful and I have honestly never heard a cinema audience weep so openly as I did on that occasion.

It was a perfect ending. It didn't need anything more. You didn't need to know what happened to Keating. You didn't need to know what happened to the boys. Everything was summed up in the few words put over in the scene and Williams' final ""Thank you, Boys"".",10
Inspirational,"Every school should have a teacher like Mr. Keating (Robin Williams). He is inspirational and teaches young men to think for themselves and look at life differently. If I'd had a teacher like that, I might have done better in school! For me, it's the theme of the story that is the most important. The acting performances are secondary. I've watched the movie about three times now, and I still find myself getting inspired - and getting a boost to my self confidence! Robin Williams is excellent in this type of role - in my opinion, I prefer his performances in drama rather than comedy.

This movie should be shown in all schools for 12-13 year olds. It's especially motivating for those who may lack confidence and are somewhat meek and mild. This movie gives them a voice. A teacher like Mr. Keating shapes the lives of young men and teaches them more than any classroom book can. It's a life affirming movie. I love the movie!",8
an uplifting heartfelt drama if given the chance,"i myself am a person who is hopelessly trying to turn friends from mainstream music and film, etc and to my delight this film encapsulates that whole idea, i particularly enjoyed hearing robins character give opinions on conformity and his quote from a poem about choosing the path less travelled, don't get me wrong this film has a slightly ""geeky"" feel to it but if you look past the extremely ""square"" characters you will find a kinship that is remarkable and the messages it sends out are that which is poignant and true, if you can look past the faults in this film you may just look past the ""faults"" in your own life and find this film as life changing as a great song or novel.",7
I didn't get it,"Please forgive me, I didn't get it! I didn't understand why everyone swoons over this movie! When you read the reviews of this film (even from IMDb members)like, ""this is the greatest movie I've ever seen!,"" it makes me wonder why I had to sit through it a second time just to see what I had to have missed! Nope, I still didn't get it! And I like Robin Williams! I liked Garp! I even liked him as that doctor in ""Awakenings"" who gave El Dopa to Robert DeNiro!

Maybe I understand all too well... maybe, just maybe the people who swoon over ""Dead Poets""share this movie's ideologies. I happen to agree with a IMDb member's comments calling this movie ""manipulative."" Overall, Dead Poets Society is a movie that drowns in it's own hypocrisy when it attempts to educate it's viewers of their absolute definition of what is good and what is evil. I gave it a 1 out of 10!",1
Carpe Diem & The Punk Rock Movie.,"Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.

Dead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.

Coming two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.

In the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10",9
Great Robin Williams Film,"Did not think that I would enjoy this film because I am not a big fan of Robin Williams who plays the role as John Keating, an English Professor who loves poetry and teaches this subject quite different than anyone else. Professor Keating gets down to basic facts about poetry and turns this subject into a very enjoyable experience which relates to how you can live in this world and have a great experience in doing whatever you really want to do and it also draws out young men's mental feelings about themselves and other people. This story also dwells with a young man named Todd Anderson, (Ethan Hawke) who is a very shy student and also had an older brother who attended this same college and was valedictorian, which are hard shoes to step into. Todd's room-mate is Neil Perry, ( Robert Sean Leonard) who has a very overbearing father and wants him to go to medical school and does not want him to waste his time on any social activities at the college. This story becomes very interesting with some of the students falling madly in love with pretty gals which makes this film a great all around treat to watch and enjoy.",8
Dead Poets Society,"""Dead Poets Society"" – A film that makes you think about your dreams and your decisions in life. Good or bad decisions

""Carpe Diem – Seize the day."" This statement is made by Mr. Keating, the special and unique teacher of ""Welton Academy"". After he had taught his students the sense of ""Carpe Diem"" and poetry, the way of thinking of many students changed and some of them started to finish what Mr. Keating had begun when he was at the same age.

If you are looking for a film to watch it in class, you should have a look at ""Dead Poets Society"". It's a 1986 drama film which is directed by Peter Weir and is set at the ""Welton Academy"" in Vermont. It deals with the teacher Mr Keating who inspires his students with his special view of life and so they build a group called ""Dead Poets Society"". They meet each other at a cave near the school where they talk about poetry to express themselves.

The cave scenes are very amusing and show the boys in funny situations during the meetings. The ""new Dead Poets Society"" consists of quite different personalities: Neil Perry, the self-confident founder of the group, the shy Todd Anderson, the noisy Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, the clever one, Charlie Dalton and last but not least Knox Overstreet, a very friendly and polite student.

You may find it easy to identify with one of the young boys because of the interesting characters. They can surprise you in different ways and can also make you laugh.

If I was asked to rate this film on a scale from 0 – 10, I would give it 7 points as the film is easy to understand and all elements, which make life worth it like love, friendship or disagreement, are included.

It's a classic with a shocking and unexpected ending.",7
My all time favorite movie,"I saw this movie the first time when I was in High-School and I was amazed from the very beginning... The feeling it left behind will stay with you for a very long time. It is a mix of big sadness but also of hope and good fellowship.

This movie has so many important and profound messages and is very moving. I think I saw it over a hundred times and I love it even more every time I see it!

Robin Williams and the Guys from School played their roles so good and touchingly!

It is my all time favorite movie I can only recommend it to everyone!

More movies like that should be produced in the future!",10
Beautiful storytelling,"The movie is really a good reminder to the mental health of our children and letting them pursue their own dreams, because the movie makes you wonder long after the movie ends. There's this thing about the movie""Dead poets society"", the more you think about the movie, the more it starts to make sense. To me, it didn't make much sense when I first watched it, but now, it is one of the dearest movies to me. If you like the student teacher bond based movies, this is a go to for you. It shows how much can a teacher influence students, and make them bigger. The scene where he quoted "" They believed they're destined for great things, just like you do.... They're now fertlizing the daffodils ."" Gave me goosebumps.",8
Review of Dead Poets Society,"""Dead Poets Society"" staring Robin Williams is quite well-known for the public and was awarded Academy Awards. After the end credits rolled, the movie proved that it deserved the awards. The story is about our society to force people to be repressed without sentimental feelings. The students in the movie seemed to reflect our uniformed world. They want to be someone with emotion and sentiment. But, the reality does not flow into the way that they want. Even though the plot could easily have become terribly common, Robin Williams and other characters had the skill to make it gripping. The masterful acting kept my attention from beginning to end. Especially, the scene that students come together and listen to the poet, ""O'me, O'life"" by Walt Whitman, made me shiver. And the words ""Carpe Diem"" which means 'seize the day', remained in my brain after the movie. I'm wondering if I live like that. So, I really hope that such a movie will be released again in theaters.",7
"""Death Wish"" for academia","It amazes me how easily people fall for cardboard characters. In real life, it would be impossible to find an educational institution so filled with boorish, vile teachers, and wimpish, intimidated students, with the exception of this one dazzling, inspiring professor. Real life doesn't work that way--no one is as perfect, or perfectly awful, as these people.

But that's not the point. The point is to set up superficial symbols of the prejudices of the audience (the stuffy conservative teachers, the heartlessly strict father, the violent jock), and knock them down with a feather, so that the audience can congratulate itself for its enlightened attitudes.

This is about what I'd expect from Robin Williams, who usually seems to gravitate to roles of this sort. However, other worthy actors fell into this trap, I hope only because a job's a job. Kurtwood Smith is known for playing another tough-guy father, but in ""That 70s Show"" he's a complex character. There, he's always threatening to ""kick ass"", but he's also capable of humor and love; here, he's a pathetic cartoon. But Robin Williams is also a cartoon, just of the opposite kind, a paragon of humanity who can do no wrong, but whom everyone but his rapt students believe is the devil.

How can they write stuff like this? Is this what passes for creativity in Hollywood? I watched this on TCM immediately after the old ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", and as angelic as the characters in that were, they at least seemed like real people. This script is as manipulative in its own way as ""Death Wish"", trying to provoke the same level of rage toward the symbols of a hated culture. It makes sense when the target is the culture of thuggish gangs who rape and murder, but of prep schools? What's so awful about prep schools? I went to one of the top schools, and believe me, it was a heck of a lot more inspiring than public school. This movie is insulting junk.",2
Robin Williams and a Stirring Tribute to Teachers!,"Have you ever had a high school English class where you were bored to death as your teacher droned on and on about Walt Whitman? I did which made me appreciate Dead Poets Society even more. This movie is about the love of teaching and how the great teachers resonate with their students and get them to fall in love with subjects they despise. What John Keating was to these students was like how my geometry teacher was with me. More than a decade after graduation, we still communicate over our shared interests. Admittedly a bit one-sided, the film nonetheless has a place in my heart. Robin Williams delivers a committed performance. The young cast is impressive (looking at you, Ethan Hawke.) The drama delivers the emotions (even if you can accuse the film of manipulation). By the end, I was choking up with emotion. I did not care that I saw the ending from miles away. The ""O Captain, O Captain"" scene tugs me every time I see it. When Robin Williams passed in 2014, this scene was used in memorium for the beloved actor.

After the success of films such as Witness, Peter Weir became in high demand. He was given the script by Jeffrey Katzenberg (who worked with Disney at the time). Weir fell in love with the script so much, he was already in the casting process mere weeks later. The script, written by Tom Schulman, was about Schulman's life at a Tennessee prep school. Interesting enough, Keating was portrayed as a sick man in the original script. Weir wisely took those scenes away because he felt the film would focus on Keating more so than the students. I believe that was a very wise choice. As much as I want to know more about Keating, the movie is all about the students. The powerful message would deliver less of a gut punch if it wasn't. Weir created a soulful movie about individualism and free expression. As someone who was moved by several great teachers, Weir captured what it meant to have such people in our lives. For a minute, it made me want to be a teacher.

Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is a painfully shy student who finally attends a conservative New England prep school, Weldon Academy in the year 1959. Todd's older brother was valedictorian at the very same school. His roommate is Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard). Neil is a very bright student who dreams of an acting career but lives under the shadow of his domineering father (Kurtwood Smith). Enter into their lives does the new English teacher, Dr. John Keating (Robin Williams). He encourages the students to follow their dreams and to not be afraid to show who they are. He uses methods such as standing on desks among other methods. He encourages them to join a secret society that he started when he attended school. Each student goes against the status quo and face life-changing moments.

Robin Williams goes dramatic to full effect but every once in a while, he will inject his humor into the proceedings. For those who despised learning about poetry in English class, you will chuckle or even whoop when Williams makes every student tear up their ""Introduction to Poetry"" nonsense. Who wants to read about parameters anyway? Williams has a strong performance, but the film is all about the kids. The kids go through some dramatic moments that require strong acting skills. The kids were up to the task. The standout is Ethan Hawke. He would, of course, grow up to be a big star. Williams would vouch for Hawke's intensity. I believed in his character arch the most. He starts the film shy but undergoes a major character transformation. Robert Sean Leonard likewise delivers a great performance. His storyline with his father is a major part of the film, so I will not say more at risk of spoilers. Just bring the tissues.

Dead Poets Society is a film that knows how to make you laugh, cry, and grip your seat with tension. It is also a loving tribute to the profession of teaching. In a world where children are expected to be who their parents want them to be, there need to be adults that challenge this notion...like John Keating. Consequences happen but are necessary in the grand scheme of things. A shoutout needs to be given for John Seale's excellent cinematography and Maurice Jarre's memorable score. The drama can be heavily one-sided and there are relationship scenes with a young lady that are undercooked, but those are just minor complaints. Robin Williams and the children are at the center of a story you'll never forget.

""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary."" My Grade: A.",9
Seize the day; be Exceptional!,"John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.

Released in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a coming-of-age drama that's one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.

This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" but he's dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.

The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""The letter kills,"" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).

There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well, but that's always the case, even with the best of films.

One possible objection is that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.

Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we'd bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.

Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action,' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.

FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven't already. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.

The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).

Better than it sounds,"I'm 15 and probably would never have looked at this in the video shop and bought it. After i was introduced to it in English class and after watching it changed my mind about old non-action films. For the first 5 minutes i was bored to death but then as the film progressed i began to understand the characters and recognize some actors. Half way though the film i thought ""Wow, I'm gonna hire this out"". The film had everything from comedy, drama, romance, suspense and enjoyment and i thought ""whats not to like"". A top notch performance by a young Ethan hawke who played a nervous Todd Anderson. Its a shame you don't get movies like this anymore but this one is an instant classic.",9
Robin Williams Lives On,"Dead Poets Society is a film about a group of boys attending a prestigious Prep school in New England during the 1950's. The story follows Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), the younger brother of a former valedictorian, and his roommate, Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a exceptionally bright, artistic student with a overbearing father.

The school rests upon four pillars: tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence. However, a new outlook comes in the form of a new teacher. The new English teacher, a former student John Keating (Robin Williams), presents the students with a different outlook and encourages the boys to seize the day. His unorthodox teaching methods stir up his students imagination and anger some of the more traditional characters in the film.

There are many themes throughout, but above all else the message is to follow your heart. The story is extremely well written and the cast of young actors do well to bring the out the uncertainties and excitement of adolescence. The set design and direction capture this period and produce a story that will pass the test of time.

Robin Williams performance in this film ranks among his best. He has departed us, but his legacy lives on. He visits us through his films and tells us ""Carpe Diem""!",9
Overrated,"Yes, Robin Williams is fine in this film. However, the film as a whole is highly overrated when you consider that the remainder of the characters are underdeveloped & the story is nothing more than a cliched commentary on free thought & expression. The only student who really stands out is Robert Sean Leonard's character, Neil. BUT, to call this Robin William's best performance is crazy when you compare the character to Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting. Also, I can't forgive the screenwriters for deliberately misquoting Walt Whitman.",6
O Captain My Captain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"About three months ago, this came on TV where I live at about 11.30 on a Saturday night (why it had to be on that late I have no idea). I taped it and watched it the next day and it's the only movie I've recently seen for the first time that really kicked me in the pants. About five days later I immediately bought the DVD. I was that blown away.

SPOILER ALERT!

It's 1959. Rebellious English professor John Keating (a wonderfully restrained, Oscar-nominated performance from Robin Williams, free of his usual quirks which are enjoyable but would be unnecessary here) arrives at Welton Academy, a posh all-boys school with an ages-old curriculum set in stone. Mr. Keating ignores the school's approved teaching methods, much to the dismay of Headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd), and instills in his students a love of poetry, inspiring them to ignore authority and make their lives extraordinary. This backfires when aspiring actor Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) commits suicide after his father (a role tailor-made for Kurtwood Smith, better known now for his identical but comic role as Red Forman in TV's ""That '70s Show"") forces him to become a doctor. Mr. Keating is blamed for this tragedy, and his remaining students stand up for him when he is threatened to be fired.

Dead Poets Society is a film about rebelling against authority. Mr. Keating is one of the great cinematic school teachers, and if he were real I'd give anything to be in his class. Williams is brilliant, but the real acting honours go to the actors playing the students, especially Leonard (who ironically now plays a doctor in TV's ""House"") and most notably a young Ethan Hawke, who delivers a tour de force performance as Todd Anderson, the student who is hit the hardest by Neil's death. Tom Schulman's glowing Oscar-winning screenplay is filled with less-than-perfect characters, a dash of much-needed humour, it avoids sentimentality and considering I often *hate* poetry, it makes the stuff seem interesting.

However, it is Australian director Peter Weir's (who makes me, a budding filmmaker myself, proud to be an Australian) masterful handling of two key scenes late in the film which catapults it way beyond average status. The first is Neil Perry's suicide scene. Neil and his father have an argument one night after his father discovers Neil acting in a stage play. His father holds the power in the conversation and orders Neil to follow a career in medicine. Later on when his parents are asleep, Neil walks into his father's study, opens a drawer in the desk, takes out his father's revolver pistol and pulls the trigger. Weir wisely splashes this scene with dull and depressing colours (blacks and whites) to suit the mood described in Schulman's script, but instead of actually showing Neil pulling the trigger, Weir cuts away to Mr. Perry laying in his bed being awoken by the chilling sound of a gunshot downstairs. This makes my hair stand on end every time I watch the film.

The second is the exceptional climax. Now that Mr. Keating has been held responsible for Neil's death, he has been fired and interrupts his former class (now taught by Mr. Nolan) to get his things before he leaves. Todd Anderson causes an outburst and sticks up for Mr. Keating by standing on his desk and shouting ""O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN!"" like Mr. Keating instructed his students. Soon half the class joins in, with Mr. Nolan shouting at them to all sit down. The class giving Mr. Keating a standing ovation shows how much one person can impact others' lives, either positively or negatively. In this case, Mr. Keating has given his students direction and a reason to live. It surely stands alongside One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back as one of the most unforgettable movie climaxes ever. Damn you, Oliver Stone.

END OF SPOILERS!

If there are any teenagers like me out there who are reading this review and haven't yet seen this remarkable film, I urge you to do so. It could just change your life.

Beautifully & Well Lit Society,"Dead Poets Society received a lot of praise upon its original release, and at first glance it's easy to see why: a very solid cast all around and backed up by strong performances. A beautifully groomed private prep school with lots of visual attention to all those little details that make the place and this film so visually inviting and rich. The main message it extolls is to 'fight/resist conformity and be yourself'. All of which I can get behind. Unfortunately, this story has been told countless times, and while this film may look better than many of the others with the same story, it doesn't really bring anything new, except of course for looking very, very good. It knows all the cliched touching points to push at exactly the right times throughout. All of this is to say that while Dead Poets Society disappoints on several levels, it is still worth checking out if your curious.",7
Absolute Classic!,"""O Captain! My Captain!"" A new English teacher, John Keating (Robin Williams), is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students, who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) and others learn to break out of their shells, pursue their dreams and seize the day.

I don't think I've ever been that emotional watching any movie ever. The movie is fabricated in a way where you build a very solid connection with all the lead characters. Normally, its pretty difficult for us to find a connection with just one main protagonist in any movie but ""Dead Poets Society"" was able to make me invested in more than one character in a 2 hours runtime only, which I personally found really impressive.

What really affected the emotional aspect was the incredible performances. Obviously, Robin Williams stands out and delivers one of my personal favourite performances even though I'm pretty sure he didn't have a lot of screen time. Additionally, the whole supporting cast was just perfect and had a really good dynamic especially Williams.

The movie really taught me a lot and I think that is very vital that people experience it and learn from it as it really is an emotional rollercoaster with a lesson.

Score:9/10.",9
not as good as the hype makes it out to be...,"I watched this film in English class this past week and I must say that I am a bit disappointed with what I saw. While many aspects of the film were perfectly engaging, I never felt grabbed by the story line, nor was I impressed with the script or, for that matter, actors.

Robin Williams' character was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. While I have always failed to see the reason for the hype Williams so often receives, I have appreciated some of his more serious roles, such as his role as the neurologist in ""Awakenings"". I was completely underwhelmed by Williams' acting in this movie. It was almost as if he was trying too hard to be the ""inspiring"" teacher and in doing so ended up being completely melodramatic, in both his ideals and his voice (he drifted in and out of a VERY annoying accent of some sort.) I'm not entirely sure why Williams was nominated for an Oscar for this role...

The numerous clichés in the film also began to get to me after a while. I truly enjoyed the scenes where the boys were hanging out and talking. These were genuinely acted and scripted and were often very endearing. But the same is not true for the majority of the movie. I felt the teacher's teaching styles were almost too exaggerated for the movie. He would play some sort of game with the kids, they'd learn a lesson, and then be miraculously changed (an example of this was the whole ""carpe diem"" on the first day and how so soon after, everything became inspirational. Another scene that comes to mind is when the teacher helps the shy boy Todd Anderson create his own poetry.) There was no real work involved for this teacher. he uttered a couple of lines of poetry (and the most insipid and well known ones at that) and the boys were then ""thinking for themselves"".

I couldn't see the whole controversy about the ""Society"" itself anyway. Much of what the boys were doing was hanging out in a cave at night. while this was certainly a ""discipline problem"", it hardly seems to pose a threat of any sort to the school.

Anyway, I was overall underwhelmed by this film, but parts of it were OK.",4
Carpe Diem !,"""Oh captain, my captain...""

I watched ""Dead Poets Society"" twice and I could watch it thousands of times without being bored ! It's absolutely perfect ! This movie is also very topical even if it takes place in the fifties. The fight against conformism is and will always be fundamental.

Some might say that this movie is demagogue but in my opinion it's an example for young people of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

As far as the cast is concerned, Robin Williams is great, as always, and the young men (among them the future star Ethan Hawke) act very well.

So watch this excellent movie and... Seize the day !",10
Geeky Randy's summary,"Film set in 1959 (based on screenwriter Schulman's own experiences at academy) about liberal English teacher Williams influencing his students who attend all-boys Welton Academy. Focuses more on the group of boys, but Williams is able to work his off-the-cuff dialogue enough to keep you reminded that it's still him. Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think. The film never takes the easy way out, with Weir and Schulman seeming perfectly content with impending gloom. Kudos also for developing how important teachers can be to their students and vice versa. Williams' character was inspired by Samuel Pickering.

★★★½ (out of four)",9
"Robin Williams tells students to ""seize the day""","Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Norman Lloyd, and Alexandra Powers star in ""Dead Poets Society,"" a 1989 film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman.

William plays an English teacher, John Keating, who comes back to his alma mater, an exclusive boys school, to teach. His teaching technique is very different from anyone else's.

His focus is on encouraging students to find themselves by reading and writing poetry, to be individuals, and to know their own hearts, to see the world in a unique way, and to take risks - ""carpe diem.""

One of the students finds Keating's old yearbook and learns he was part of something called The Dead Poets Society. When he's asked about it, Keating says that he and some of his fellow students met in a cave and read poetry.

Neil (Leonard) and his friends Todd (Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), Gale (Charlie Dalton) and others form the club again, find the cave, and sneak out at night. They read, laugh, and joke.

The boys are inspired by Keating and, in their own lives, try to break out. Each has his own story but the main focus is Neil, whose dictatorial father is insisting that he become a doctor when in his heart, he wants to be an actor.

Unfortunately, the school doesn't exactly want students to think for themselves and neither do their parents. Problems arise due to Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and opening these kids' minds.

What a beautiful movie and what great imagery of birds flying free, the boys standing on their school desks and seeing the room from a different perspective, that idea of being ""up high"" used when Neil late at night looks out the window of his home.

The film is predictable, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. It's set in 1959, and yes, kids did what their parents told them to do, and if your parents didn't like your choice of career, you were discouraged from going into it.

I know someone who wanted to have a career in the army; his parents flew to Germany to see him. The young man returned, became an attorney, and was never a good one, nor a very happy person.

Someone else I know actually got a part on Broadway and her parents made her return to her home town. Yes, that kind of thing happened. If you're creative like Neil, you can't really suppress it - the soul cries out for something else.

Robert Sean Leonard, Wilson on ""House"" is very young here. He gives a marvelous performance. I've seen him on Broadway twice - he's a very serious and committed actor. Everyone is good in this well-cast film.

Robin Williams absolutely shines as a warm, funny man who loves to teach and who believes teaching goes way beyond just the subject. He's just fantastic.

For me, anyway, there weren't a lot of surprises in this film, but I loved it. It was both uplifting and depressing - the school wants the students to meet the status quo, and Keating wanted them to fly. Today, it's still not easy being different.",8
Nice movie on defying conformity,"The movie digs deep about the very foundational idea of conforming whether to the general idea of well being, which may not be in line with one's own choice, or to live and let live the very desires that makes one feels very much alive. The premise is inserted well in the theme of artistic literature and the philosophical paradigm it comes with. There is less twists in the steady build up and flow of the story. But the dramatization is superb. It's able to grasp most, if not all, the essential issues concerning the period of the younger adulthood. The movie is then capped by a great sequence of finale events that question the idea of loyalty, not just to the friends beside you, but also to yourself and your belief. Robin Williams acted out good here, although I have to say that this is not his best performance. It's nice to see Ethan Hawke's earlier works in this movie. And it's quite a loss that most of the other actors of this class don't really make a long career.",7
O Captain! My Captain!,"This movie is package of perfection. Everything is perfect. Direction level is damn too high. Cast did their job superbly especially Robin Williams. Background sound is too good. Editing is well enough. Best thing about this movie is that it consists of dream, emotion, love, success, passion and drama. You will get a unknown(?) feeling after watching this movie. You can not describe that feeling to anyone. Finally, one thing i can say ""O Captain! My Captain!""",10
Worst Robin Williams Movie,"This movie could have been an interesting cultural and social statement about students attempting to study literature and to be creative in their own individual ways. But that is not what happens in the movie. Based on my observations of the teacher's attitudes and techniques, everything starts on the wrong foot.

Now, the teacher played by Robin Williams proclaims to the students that one should be free-spirited and to be a seeker after art and truth. That is one of the purposes of poetry. There is nothing wrong with that at all. However, that is not what happens in the movie. The teacher played by Robin Williams encourages students to tear out part of a textbook because he disagrees with the author's comments. When I was a student, there were things that I disagreed with in some books, but I would never tear out the pages. How does tearing out pages of a book with which one disagrees encourage creativity and learning ? Moreover, how does such an action teach a student to respect the views of other people, whether you agree with them or not? This type of action tends to foster intolerance rather than creativity. In addition, in the film, the students are encouraged to ""find their own space"" by wandering around or by standing on top of their desks? This seems to have some value in a psychology experiment, but may have dubious value in a course of English literature.

There is a difference between being ""free-spirited"" on one hand and rebellious on the other. Being ""free-spirited"" implies a desire to explore the unknown and to seek truth and beauty. This does not happen in the movie. Rather, the students decide to use some of the comments that they heard in the class to rebel against and provoke the administration. In once case, one student gets paddled. And for what purpose ?

Next, the film could have been an interesting experiment in synthesizing the different approaches to pedagogy when comparing the ""old school"" structured techniques of the school dean with the ""free spirited"" techniques of the teacher played by Robin Williams, but once again, this does not happen in the movie. Rather, a full-blown adversary relationship develops which ends tragically. As mentioned earlier, the two points of view and systems can be brought together in harmony, but a meeting of the minds does not happen in the film. A vicious spirit of intolerance develops among the protagonists on both sides, not just with the school dean, but among the students as well.

What later develops in the film is a total disaster as the two systems of pedagogy remain at enmity with each other as Robin Williams is eventually forced out of his position at the school. (One reviewer of this movie stated that the Robin Williams character was trying to use the students as ""cannon fodder"" in order to wage some sort of battle with the conservative administration for reason that were unclear. Somehow, I did not pick up on that. If true, then the Robin Williams character deserved to be terminated.) Worst of all still, death becomes a reality when one of the students commits suicide, something which should never have entered the plot. The student commits suicide because of his father's objections over his extracurricular thespian activities. Here, one could have come to some sort of common ground between the ""old school"" attitudes of the father vis-a-vis the ""free spirited"" lifestyle of his son. But, once again, this does not happen in the movie. Instead, the son kill himself, a cowardly act to be sure, something which should never have happened. From here, the plot degenerates at an accelerated rate. The film at this point becomes totally unwatchable.

The teacher played by Robin Williams is not the direct cause of the suicide, but his approach to unrestrained, unstructured pedagogy that borders on nihilism is a factor that leads up to the events that precede the plot's tragedy. I would like to think that the teacher portrayed by Robin Williams had good intentions that went wrong.

Robin Williams has been in better films such as ""Patch Adams"" and ""Goog Morning, Vietnam"". But this film represents his cinematic nadir.

I rated this film 1 out of 10. I would have rated it a total 0 because of the direction of the plot. However, I think 0 out of 10 would still be too generous.

Robin Williams should have won an Oscar,"I fell in love with this film at first viewing. It broke my heart and quickly entered in to my own private top five movies. Robin Williams is one of the most versatile actors in the industry. He plays drama and comedy with the same intensity and that is so rare. Understandably though, he was nominated against a tough crowd that year (Morgan Freeman-Driving Miss Daisy, Daniel Day-Lewis-My Left Foot (winner), Kenneth Branagh-Henry V, and Tom Cruise-Born on the Fourth of July).",10
A poem to a life worth living,"This is a very dear movie to me. I was in high school when I watched, 30 years ago, and now I fully understand why it moved me so much. At this moment I sit here after watching it again, and having lived and learned so much, and I realize that it touched something in me that was going to be very important in my life, in which my role has always been to look at things from a different perspective. And, like Thoreau, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, and that I did and do as much as I can. Thank you Robin W for giving life to my most beloved and awake teacher. I would have got up on that table too, to tell you oh captain, my captain!",10
Great Movie. A Must See!,"It's my all time favorite! When I first saw this movie, it was in my 9th grade English class (and it was an assignment). I didn't like it the first time, but as I watched it the second time, I fell in love with it. Now it's on DVD, and I can enjoy it even more. Robin Williams plays a dramatic English teacher guiding his students to explore new insights. Robert Leonard plays the passionate son of an unreasonable demanding father. Ethan Hawke plays his new best friend who dares not to speak in front of anybody for his fear of people not listening to his ideas. Norman Lyodd plays the heartless headmaster who believes the role of tradition is more important than the hopes and dreams of the students at Welton. When I went to the website that had scripts of deleted scenes, some I wished had stayed in the film. I loved this movie because I could imagine myself being a part of the film. Thumbs up to the actors and the directors.",10
"O Captain, My Captain!","The movie I recently watched is undoubtedly one of the finest cinematic creations of all time. It delivers a profound message about never surrendering to conformity and the importance of seizing the day. Life is a precious, fleeting gift, and we exist on this planet only once before eventually departing from it. To truly experience existence and avoid the confines of conformity, we must embrace our individuality. Just as we will ultimately decompose, the film reminds us that we mustn't let ourselves decay in the mold of societal expectations.

This movie has etched itself into my memory, even though I watched it 34 years after its release. It served as a poignant reminder that our beliefs are uniquely ours, and it's possible that the crowd may cast judgment. However, we are the creators of our own lives, and it's our responsibility to shape our destinies. This realization was both profound and transformative.",8
Perfect movie for growing teens,"I recently re-watched this film at my current ripe age of 30. I haven't watched this movie since the mid 90s when I watched it on TV. So that puts about 10-12 years since I've last seen it.

I rented this movie because I recalled that it made such an impression on me. After watching the film again, I can remember why. The protagonists are a group of impressionable teenagers who are about to enter college. This is the age at which I saw this film.

Robin Williams' character, Keating, is introduced as a teacher of poetry but becomes a teacher of life. His lessons of carpe diem (""seize the day""), living life to its fullest and nonconformity are the types of messages that ring true in the hearts and minds of teenagers.

At this age, I find the film pleasurable but when I watched it at the time, I felt truly inspired. It was the sort of film that really made me think and feel and the general ideas sat with me for some time.",9
Very good film,"Robin Williams plays a professor of poetry, John Keating at the prestigious Welton School, with a management making sufficient hay with the schools continual academic shine. His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating, the deans soon latch on to the one opportunity(or mis-opportunity I must say) that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession. The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality. A young Ethan Hawke playing an even younger student redeems his professors every drop of sweat with ""Oh Captain! My Captain!""",7
I wish I had seen this movie sooner.,"I could agree with Roger Ebert had I not watched the movie from a completely different view point. For me, the movie works as an insight into a few boys life at Welton in 1959. First of all that year excites me, they were on the cusp of revolution and perhaps a few could predict what would happen a year later but the mini revolution that was started at the school, the daring concept of character over tradition, was something that would change those boys lives. In good ways, in bad ways but ultimately it would be a test of their characters in BIG ways.

The story starts off with a new teacher. Robin Williams plays the passionate John Keating. He wants to teach the boys poetry ..not lines, but poetry in their souls. It is that spirit of such poetry and the spirit of carpe diem (seize the day) that is lit like a candle in some boys and a fire in others; Neil, Todd, Charlie, Knox, Meeks and Pitts as well as a few other of their classmates.

Neil (Robert Sean Leonard pre, pre House) is a star pupil who wants to act, Todd (Ethan Hawke) is the new shy boy, Charlie (Gale Hansen) makes the boys laugh and us audience laugh and swoon, Knox (Josh Charles) is the one who dares to woo a girl he meets at a formal dinner, Meeks is the sweet boy and he and Pitts are scientifically both challenged and inspired.

Mr Keating tells them to rip out anything that restricts their thinking. Poetry should be FELT. After all, we each have poetry in us and we each apply it in different ways. Not everyone actually reads and writes poetry, some spend hours trying to find a solution to a problem. That is what the movie is about to me, the spirit of that poetry and I feel it could have alienated people had it been more about the poetry, instead it doesn't pay ""lip service"" to poets and poems, but it gets right down to their core; which is their spirit.

And I would have done what they did in their cave meetings too, which is basically have fun.

My only minor ""problem"" with the movie lies in what Keating says- despite not being a scientist myself, I believe science can also be a source of beauty, poetry and something to stay alive for also. But I'm taking Mr Keating too literally and I'm sure Meeks and Pitts who were the scientists would have remembered what Mr Keating said and applied passion to science.

The tragedy of the movie lies in the most passionate and proactive personality in the movie, the one whose Mr Keating's teachings light a fire inside. It is even more tragic given the year..perhaps ten years later, what happens would not have happened, one has to wonder.

There have been those who find that storyline unrealistic and yet it is realistic, in that it happens. It's also a cautionary tales to parents who want to live through their children, I can even see similarities in this movie and Mahabharat which is a big epic in India based on fact.

For me it took time to understand the character involved the storyline, because the movie is not a sit down let's talk type, it doesn't give you the answers, it doesn't underestimate the audience, it's an old school movie. I will say no more other than I think this character wanted to seize the passion.

And like life, things and people in Dead Poets Society are always moving, the movie relies on you as an audience to pay attention and you might, just might, catch something that you missed before or that the person next to you missed. Poetry isn't going to make your life neat and tidy nor is it going to change your life, that is up to you. Mr Keating didn't come along with an in depth character analysis and the movie is dynamic, it has kinetic energy, when you see Welton, you see see different angled shots in the corridors, in class rooms, outside you see nature, there's music, on paper it sounds like any other movie but on screen Dead Poets Society is alive. Mr Keating represents the movie..and we represent the students. He COULD change our lives..if we keep ourselves open to what he says. That's how I like to watch this movie.

And the final scene was not trite nor sweet to me, nor a kiss up, it was a final straw for a a living, breathing, sad, perhaps angry and inspired soul of a student AND a boy. A sweet ending wouldn't have any of that because it would tie things up and not leave them open. But like life Dead Poets Society isn't a carefully arranged neat little present. It's only neatness lies in how its made, a beautiful quality of a movie, I don't know the technical terms but I can say the cinematography and the direction are not slow, or too fast, when Keating is talking you see his words in each of the students faces, their reactions. Peter Weir the director has links between his movies, action and reaction and every person taking charge of their life, you watch Gallipoli, The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it's about human spirit. The final scene of Dead Poets Society is about human spirit, don't conform, take charge of your life and make a stand for what you believe in. The power of that scene can be applied to a grand action or a small one, but it's something I remember whenever I am forced to cower, with the rest of the world as Mr Nolans- the headmaster of Welton, trying to get me to their way or to be quiet. Except I watched the movie and I won't.",10
"Seize the day, watch this film.","I have watched this movie many times, the last time being just a few hours ago. And it just never stops getting to the deepest side of me. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry; and when it ends, it leaves me trembling... I tremble and I too want to step on the table. I want to go outside and sound my barbaric YAWP over the rooftops of all and eat the world like it's a cookie, like it's mine.

I don't think there's anything missing from this film. The plot is great, it is beautifully made and all the performances are really powerful and moving. It doesn't make your life extraordinary, because that's your duty, but it surely makes you want to do it.

I say seize the day and go watch this film right now; watch it many times and suck out all the marrow of it. Let it get to the deepest side of you too.

Let's all open our minds and be Dead Poets! Because that's what this excellent film is all about. That's what life is all about.",10
"O Captain, my Captain!","Where do I even begin. At first I was going to describe this film as a very bittersweat masterpiece. But then I rember John Keatings words, ""Avoid using the word ""very"" because its lazy"". Only one of many iconic lines in this movie delivered by Robin Williams. I feel that this movie has had a very big impact on a lot of people, in a deep and raw way. I've been thinking about what could be causing it, is it the wonderful casting in the movie? Is it the scenografi that Peter Weir and his team have created from scratch? Or is it the outstanding storytelling that characterizes the film throughout? My answer to these questions is that it is all combined. It is these puzzle pieces that together form a whole and brings the film to life. Robin William, rest in peace, portrays his character (Mr. Keating) so well. William have the power to always interact with his audience and bring all of his charters to life, this is no exception. In addition to Williams' outstanding performance, there are also several child actors who do a brilliant job! Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles and Gale Hansen makes excellent efforts. If you take the brilliant casting and combins it with a story that is deep, heavy, thoughtful but most of all scially crogical, you have Dead Poets Society. A must see for all movie lovers out there!",10
"Great, especially for school goers/teenagers","Very good movie overall. Some weak parts, overshadowed though by other extremely powerful ones.",7
One of my favorites,I love this movie with everything I have. The cast is very hot . And Robin Williams is just amazing of course in this role.,10
I wanted to give this a 10,"I really loved this movie when it started, even with all the sentimentality and cliches. But when the ""tragedy"" happened, I was left gobsmacked. A main character performs an action that had no buildup, motivation, or meaning. I was devastated, but I also felt manipulated. There is something hollow at the core of this movie; lots of events happen, but aren't given much meat or substance. The only things that save Dead Poets Society is the wonderful performance of Robin Williams and also the boys, who were believable teenagers.",7
"The film that inspired me the most as a teenager..in a word, wonderful!","With director Peter Weir at the helm, here's a truly terrific film that's stood the test of time very well. Beautifully crafted with standout performances from Robin Williams(as the unconventional English professor), Ethan Hawke & Robert Sean Leonard, the film celebrates individuality and all those who want to ""seize the day"" and live life to the full.

Full of warmth, wit and real perception, it's a joy from first to last though inevitably very poignant too as befits anything advocating an unequivocal embracing of all that life has to offer. I already wanted to write when I first saw this film in 1990 and it confirmed my career choice. I could wax lyrical about this all day but no, just watch it!",10
Bright stars,"In the heart of more prolific days, Peter Weir directed this bold anti-establishment gem, starring a conspicuously reined-back Robin Williams as the unorthodox English teacher John Keating - a name that sounds like a poet's, to match the man's passion for the passion of individual will. Williams would do more nuanced, angrier work in Good Will Hunting eight years later, but this was the movie that showed the world he was more than Mork.

The real star of the show is Robert Sean Leonard as the tragic trickster Puck (AKA Neil Perry), whose father can't afford for him to fail, but who cannot live without his thespian dream. With a luminescence reminiscent of Jim Carrey (who would take the titular lead in possibly Weir's finest, The Truman Show), Leonard beautifully portrays the joy and agony of personal expression's vital extremes.

As usual, Weir's aesthetic is classic yet distinct, never bellowing for attention but occasionally coming alive to provide an indelible image: a bicycle sending a wave of birds into the sky; a shy student spinning in a poetic trance; a tiny lost figure stumbling onto a frozen harbour.

Maurice Jarre's ugly synth score is slightly jarring (no pun intended), but Weir is on hand to furnish his soundtrack with a series of well-chosen classical pieces, most memorably two Beethoven excerpts, including the possibly divine ""Emperor"" second movement, which helped burn Picnic at Hanging Rock into our brains.

There's little subtlety in this Society, but there is a wealth of humanity and truth, and a boundless idealism, amounting to another fine fable in the canon of a modest auteur.",7
DON'T FALL FOR THIS MOVIE!,"Many people think this is a great movie, but it isn't. This movie was incredibly cliche and sappy. The ending is so dumb I wanted to throw up. Watch and you will see what I mean. This movie gets an important idea wrong. If this teacher was a great one, the students would love the poetry they were reading rather than the teacher himself. I don't think the kids learned the greatness of the words they were reciting in the movie. Here are some other things that bothered me:

1. The students weren't good actors with the exception of Ethan Hawke 2. The scenes where Dead Poet's Society meetings take place are horribly written. 3. The screenplay takes every easy way out instead of finding a more clever and satisfying solution. 4. It is full of cliches like the disapproving parent walking in through the back door during their child's big performance. 5. The love story is stupid, pointless, and distracting. Although I liked one or two scenes, the movie dose not impress me. If you don't agree, watch the movie carefully, and you'll realize it only tugs at your heart strings because the movie was created to do only that and not to create intelligent afterthought. This movie is one simple, retarded, and under intelligent audiences.",3
Best Movie Of All Time,"The first time I saw Dead Poets Society the only thing I wanted to do was watch it again. I have seen the movie approximately 100 times. Each time I watching it becomes more and more enthralling. It is the only movie that acts like a drug to me. The more I see it, the more I yearn to see it again.

Dead Poets Society strikes me so hard and passionately that it is hard to differentciate myself from the story and the characters. The cast of character in personality and over all style is me and my friends. I am involved in the theatre arts and I feel as if I know Neil's passion for acting. My friends all fit in line with characters from girl crazy to tall lanky and awkward. I know everyone in this film which makes it more meaningful to me.

When I first saw the movie I had never had anything touch me in that way, and I don't ever expect to see a movie like it again.",10
Greatest Movie I'd ever Seen,"You watch this movie, your life will never be the same. You will become a different person, who tries to fight your way to achieve your dreams! Don't die before watching this movie!! You'll realize that any dreams and goals is possible, after watching this movie. That you can break away from stupid systems in your environment!! I mean it! Carpe diem, seize the day! I love the character of the teacher, who inspires his students to be 'free in mind' and be themselves. Unlike the current educational system that limit students' spirit and creativity, crazy teacher like him should be promoted more!!! I wish I could be one of the students, and experience the unique methods of teaching. Too bad I don't have a copy of the DVD, gotta have one, soon!!",10
One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing.,"One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing.

Well written and wonderfully acted, this film does that something, which many films on teenagers fail to do. It inspires us to go out and live a life. To LIVE is a great deed for a teenager who will be missing out on life, in the run for the rot. The rot includes fulfilling aspirations of parents which are way different from his own, it include running for the marks and grades, it includes missing out on fun which we are supposed to have as teenagers, it essentially includes that we do not identify our dream and shall be living others dreams. Teenagers or adolescents do not know what they want to be in many cases, they figure that out as they grow. This can be because of influence by friends or by the college teachers or even an idea he just got or maybe a talent which he would have recognized just then. But before realizing that, they are pushed in many cases by parents into a corner and the parents squeeze what they want them to be. It is a failure and many teenagers succumb to this pressure and even give up life. The more than half, ordinary guys follow the aspirations of their parents which they believe is good for them. Because of the more or less universal thought that ""Parents think for the good of their kids"". Though in many cases it is true, it is a big lie in few cases.

I take my life as an example, I wanted to do arts, but I was pushed into engineering. Now, I am not a good artist nor a considerable engineer. I am bad at both and I attribute the failure of this, to the choice done by my elders, who have not tried to figure out my aspirations and simply let me be what I want to be. Such, is the life of Neil Perry (played by Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor, while his father does not want him to be that.

Acted wonderfully by Robin Williams, who plays the part of John Keating this film speaks volumes of how good an actor Robin is. His eyes and his mere sigh do tell a lot, which so many histrionics could not have said. This is a very controlled performance by Robin, and in this film and ""Good Will Hunting"" I rate his acting as his best ever till date.

But the best part is not Robin Williams here, it is Peter Weir the director, who makes the scenes so personal and they can be related to many teenagers. We had fantasies in our teens, we wanted to be something big and something different, we wanted to acquire talents that will take us forward in our lives. So it is very easy to relate to any teenager or an adult who seems to have missed his teens.

The another best or great part if Tom Schulman, who wrote the screenplay, giving us the wonderful lines and scenes that shall be etched in our memory long after we have watched it. this is one of the few films, I fall back on when I look for some inspiration, it essentially helps us write.

Like in one scene, Robin Williams gives his students an Onion and asks them to see if they can write a poem on that. Damn, good it is.

I am going with 5/5, this is wonderful and I like it, in fact Love it. My favorite dialog is the most famous line of Robin ""Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary""",10
Poetry in motion,I like the bit where he said captain my captain and stood on the chair,10
Less than the sum of its parts,"DPS has a number of very good scenes; the ""carpe diem"" scene near the beginning, and Todd's impromptu meditation on a photo of Walt Whitman, come to mind. Unfortunately these and other less brilliant scenes add up to something which as a whole isn't as satisfying.

As others have said, by the end of the movie these boys have gained affection for their teacher, not for poetry. In the course of a semester, I suppose a couple of extraordinary (...ahem) classes, in which the boys are told to stand on their desks, walk around the courtyard, etc, would not pose a problem...given that they spent the rest of the time reading, discussing, and perhaps writing poetry. We don't see much of that, though. ...why is it that Robin Williams always has to do a John Wayne impression? He does it here, he did it in Mrs. Doubtfire, and Good Morning Vietnam, and in The Birdcage. He's very good, of course, but...enough already.

The scenes in the cave...ridiculous?? Of course! Weren't you ridiculous when you were 17?

This is worth seeing for a number of inspired and moving scenes; but taken as a whole, the movie doesn't work quite as well. Still worth seeing; but too flawed to be called great.",7
"Not bad for ""coming of age"" film but desultory re poetry and pedagogy","I agree with and cannot improve on many of the comments already posted: 1) superficial references to poetry undermine John Keating's supposedly transformative message, so that his instruction becomes messianic or charismatic rather than revelatory (BUT the chanting and marching while reciting ""The Congo"" seemed authentically musical and revealing of the poet's intentions); 2) sophomoric excesses undermined the authenticity of multiple issues, especially Neil Perry's relationship to his father (BUT Keating's interaction with Charlie Dalton after his realistic prank was a useful and effective exception); 3) failures to flesh out other students at Welton or students at other schools defaulted on definition of what made Keating's classes different, other than terrific impressions of Marlon Brando and John Wayne (BUT that certainly captures part of the entertainment culture in secondary and higher education TODAY, albeit perhaps not in 1962); and 4) utterly false notes such as Mr. Cameron's craven speech to his comrades in the closet (BUT great scenes such as Neil's and Todd's conversing over the desk set partly redeem the film).

I am grateful for a previous poster's having posted the Robert Frost poem, for I believe that the use of that poem in the film by itself diagnoses a major flaw in the film's makers. Please read the Frost poem carefully. I believe that Frost unambiguously tells us that, RETROSPECTIVELY, we claim that we took a less popular path and that that choice explains our difference or betterness. Frost carefully and repeatedly makes it clear that the two paths were almost indistinguishable. Only when reviewed later and from a distance does the preferred road get redefined as ""striking out for new ground"" and other pretentious nonsense. When I first watched the film, I was incensed when Keating retraced the popular misconception that Frost was advising his readers to dare the road less traveled by because that would make all the difference. I found that part of the film doubly disappointing because Frost's important insight was distorted and because Keating, by restating the popular view, was violating his own advice. At that moment, Keating made his students' and my lives quite ordinary!

I doubt that the screenwriter or director ever read the poem carefully. Indeed, I hope for their sakes that they did not. Instead, they took the after-dinner speaker's misappropriation of Frost's poetry for the words that Frost selected.

For the reasons above and others, then, I concur that ""Dead Poets Society"" butchered poetry and the teaching of poetry (BUT I agree with Keating about the ""American Bandstand"" approach in the preface to the assigned text).

However, I also agree with commenters who laud the film as a coming of age film. If one ""read"" DPS as the story of Todd Anderson (and, to a far lesser degree, Knox Overstreet), it would be a far better film. Indeed, Todd likely remembers Mr. Keating for Todd's impromptu rap on Walt Whitman, sweaty teeth, and truth as an inadequate blanket. Looking back, Todd may indeed see a road less traveled by. That road's reward had far more to do with risk-taking, personalized instruction than with poetry.

In sum, this movie is nowhere near as bad as contrarians have asserted. It is nowhere near as good as admirers have claimed. It is an incomplete accomplishment.",7
My favorite movie- it could change you if you let it!,"I don't cry very often in movies, but I cry every time near the end of this one. To show what a profound influence literature and free thought can have on young minds is priceless, and to tie in the passion of Thoreau, Whitman, Shakespeare and others makes this movie invaluable. I have seen it close to 50 times, and always feel as if I have just watched it for the first time. Robin Williams is fantastic, and gives what I still consider the best performance of his career. Don't believe what some of the critics say about this movie (the main message of the movie is to think for yourself and be your own person!); watch it with an open mind and you could be changed forever.",10
A fairly good Robin Williams vehicle if nothing else,"Well-produced and well-acted, with Robin Williams as the standout (in one of his more consistently bearable performances). Essentially it's about some students who 'carpe diem' to varying degrees of success/failure. One overcomes shyness (well, sort of); one succumbs to parental pressure (in an eerie, overwrought, somewhat awkward scene); one gets his girl; one gets TWO girls; all participate in nocturnal cave meetings whose purpose I can't easily seem to relate to that of a poets' society (the dead ones would certainly turn in their graves methinks). Overall the story seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, and the final effect is one of dramatic indigestion. A better recommendation (and yet more Robin Williams) would be Good Will Hunting (1997). And if for some reason you're suddenly hooked on adolescents spouting poetry and wish to be punished, then go for Romeo+Juliet (1996). A weak 7/10.",6
A ghastly attempt to understand teenagers,"To see this movie really made me angry and to be honest it made me scared. The teenagers depicted in this movie act like 9 year olds meeting a clown for the first time (Mr Keating). The laugh and cheer at his every move, they swallow everything he tells them and they run around and say ""carpé diem"" like it was the hippest expression since ""thats tits"". The directing is bland and uninspiring and the acting is even though good in one way completely realistic (I blame this on a crappy script though rather than the actors).

I wan't Robin Williams to play something else than creepy super friends with tons of hilariousness at his hands and I think ""One hour photo"" is the right way to go in the future because seeing him like this again would seriously aggravate me.",3
May Dead Poets Live On!,"When ""The Simpsons"" comments on this movie destroying the profession of education, it made me want to watch it. This movie is good for ten reasons...

1) Peter Weir directs with a haunting hand and certain scenes show it very well. 2) Robin Williams blew me away as John Keating. It made me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. 3) The story and plotting were exceptional. I didn't expect the suicide scene near the conclusion. 4) Ethan Hawke showed his early star power here as the silent student who wants to be a poet. 5) Robert Sean Leonard pulled in an excellent performance as the student wanting to do things his way. 6) All the supporting performances were well-done and not overacted. 7) The cinematography was crisp and clear. The scene with the bike going down the hill is the best example I can offer there. 8) This was a movie about a teacher inspiring students and I have a soft spot for films like this. 9) There is a good warning in film about actions having unexpected and very unintentional consequences. 10) The last five minutes are unbelieveable. If I were in a theater, I would have given a standing ovation.

With those reasons, this film gets 10 out of 10! ""The Dead Poets Society"" rules and may it live on. Here ends my rant!",10
Leaves of Class,"In 1959 Delaware (as Vermont), charismatic poetry teacher Robin Williams (as John Keating) arrives to begin work at the ""Welton Academy"" preparatory school for boys. An alumni of the school, Mr. Williams teaches poetry with uncommon zeal. To gain attention, he demands students tear out the pages of books written by essayists with whom he does not agree. To get participation, he invites students to stand on the teacher's desk. Williams does impersonations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. His motto is ""Seize the Day,"" a directive made popular by novelist Saul Bellow. Yes, this class is fun...

Williams teaches the ""dangers of conforming,"" and encourages students to think for themselves. When they learn Williams belonged to a clandestine club called the ""Dead Poets Society"" when he was a ""Welton"" student, the class decides to revive the group. They meet in a cave to read poetry by the masters - but, mainly, they just goof around. Playing the saxophone and sharing ""Playboy""-type centerfolds accompany Walt Whitman. Because Williams'' influence extends perilously beyond the classroom, his ""unorthodox teaching methods"" get the popular teacher in trouble with school administrators...

This above average production won good notices and award consideration for director Peter Weir and star Robin Williams. Originally, the teacher held back a secret; ""Oscar""-winning writer Tom Schulman was persuaded to drop the idea, so we and the character are left with a gap. Williams' ""Keating"" is put on the sidelines in favor of the students. Nothing against the actors, who perform exceptionally, but they do look more like handsome young college-aged models than typical high-school aged boys. There is some physical diversity in the extended supporting cast, though. A few of the boys wear glasses...

The main stars are sensitive writer Ethan Hawke (as Todd Anderson) and his roommate, aspiring actor Robert Sean Leonard (as Neil Perry). The next tier includes prankster Gale Hansen (as Charlie Dalton) and lovelorn Josh Charles (as Knox Overstreet). Although these players are almost interchangeable, the actors create distinguishable characters. Best of the remaining parts goes to Dylan Kussman (as Richard Cameron), who perversely turns out to be the group's real non-conformist. The film is too self-consciously calculating and manipulative to be fully masterful, but it sure looks nice.

******** Dead Poets Society (6/2/89) Peter Weir ~ Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Gale Hansen",8
Great movie,"For once a story that doesnt have a happy ending. Dead poets society is a tragic story of a young man wishing to be an actor but for his stubborn father who wants and demands him to be a doctor. This is not the only story however, there are other tales such as love, compassion and humour. It is a great film and I have to admit I was sceptical when I saw that Robin Williams was the main star. However, he is brilliant in this movie and makes it work as the compassionate and funny Mr. Keating.

Rating 9/10. Great.",9
Great tearjerker,"Great tearjerker What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.

Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.",7
No more words: just see and love it,"I saw ""The dead poets society"" on TV for the umpteenth time, after at least ten years. And I felt like writing something about this awesome picture and I am happy to write the first review of the year with a movie full of faith, inspiration and courage. It is certainly one of my ten favourite pictures, each time capable of arousing such a strong emotional impact, that words seem to be insufficient, as too limited and limiting. In this sense, I think it is very difficult to say something new, or vaguely original about such a masterpiece that can speak and appeal naturally to the public without needing any praising words. However, after seeing it I couldn't but compare the impact it exerted on me the first time I saw it, being in my teens, and now, being a young woman. The first time represented a revelation, Joyce would call it an epiphany, I was totally absorbed and completely overwhelmed and, although not being able to get subtle and more mature hints, it was from the moment I saw it that I could clearly distinguish between teachers who meant teaching as a vocation, and those who just taught to make a living. I never had the fortune of enjoying a teacher of such a sort, but could feel those who really felt the responsibility of educating, and growing children and not only passing information to them. This time I still felt deeply emotionally involved, and still in the last scene I wanted to enter and stand on that desk, and join the students shouting ""Oh Captain, My captain"". Let's admit, that even though the student's years are far away, I still look forward to meeting a man like him, as endowed with a sensitivity and a human depth that would make him an ideal friend, or a perfect soul-mate. In the end, I can only say: see it and feel it, I have no children, nor students, but if I had I would let them see it, and I would consider it as a precious gift.",10
Powerful,"First time teacher MADE us watch this in school and I wasn't so excited first - the title isn't the best to make young people interested... It took time to notice that this is a good movie, there are jokes and sad scenes. Also this is one of those movies that give me the strange energic feeling, strength to climb up the walls... When the boys climb on their desks saying ""o captain, my captain"", I feel like doing the same! And then the end. I feel I can understand Neal, strongly hate his father who ruins his dream. I know they are only characters but- Second time watching this I started crying BEFORE you-know-what-if-you've-seen-this.",7
"Try Demian, Potter or Vietnam instead","Well I'd heard great things about this movie, but it didn't really cut the mustard for me.

There are potentially great issues up for debate here, but they are not properly dealt with in this movie: - does the traditional, disciplined style of education work? - should parents strongly direct their children's career paths? - are teenagers easily influenced by parents, teachers etc. or not? - is it possible to pull by making an idiot of yourself?

I went to a public school (message to non UK readers - ""public"" means ""private, elitist"" in the UK) albeit not as a border and nowhere near as grand a place as that depicted in the film. I recognised some of the boys angst. I recognised some of the teacher types - even Keating seemed like only a slightly exaggerated form of one or two teachers I knew.

But the film didn't work. It seemed manipulative to me. It didn't grapple with the issues where it mattered. It was sanctimonious. It was predictable. No school that stuffy would have hired such a notorious alumnus to teach.

If you want great stuff on influences on young people and their educational angst, try reading Demian and/or The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse. If elitist schools is your bag, read or see the Harry Potter stuff. If Robin Williams being the maverick takes your fancy, try Good Morning, Vietnam.

Life is short, so when ""gathering ye rosebuds while ye may"", I suggest you gather some other stuff and give the dead poets a miss.",4
"Depressing, but one of my all-time favorites","I saw this movie in my English class two years ago. I fell in love with it. It's a tad depressing because of what happens, but there is some comic relief in the movie. It's one of the few older movies that is one of my favorite, or that I like. It's also one of two movies I saw in a class that I liked (the other one being one of the movie versions of ""Lord of the Flies""). Robin Williams is in one of his best roles as Mr. John Keating (aka 'O Captain My Captain'), and he was very inspiring to both boys and girls alike. Even though there weren't many female roles, I'm a female, and I adored this movie. So, in the words of Mr. Keating, carpe diem! Go rent this movie!",10
Life-changing,"This movie is absolutely life-changing and one that you will undoubtedly remember for the rest of your life, changing little by little the way you perceive life.

This movie is a wake-up call to the dangers of conformism, to enjoy our life at the most (""seize the day""), to try to look at things from different perspectives and, more importantly to me, that no matter what others think, we have the power to change the world and make our own destiny.

""The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?"".

This movie is pure poetry within frames and something that will, certainly, make us reflect on our lives for a long time, and, hopefully,""make our lives extraordinary"".",10
Ending powerful,"Ending powerful. This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor. The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to. I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie. It is a movie where you would watch many times and each time find something new with it.",8
An Ode To Non-Conformity And Artistic Endeavor,"It's easy to look back on ""Dead Poets Society"" and see only cliche (standing on desks, ""oh captain my captain"", etc.). But this is the film that invented the tropes themselves! If you can look past a little bit of over-exposed (from the present viewpoint) cheese, you'll find an utterly timeless film that may have been the zenith of one acting talent and the launching point of another.

For a very basic overview, ""Dead Poets Society"" focuses on a prestigious East Coast preparatory school in 1959. The students have their entire future mapped out (law, medicine, politics, etc.) and are under intense pressure to succeed by strict prefects and even stricter parents. Introduced to this atmosphere is new English professor John Keating (Robin Williams), whose unconventional teaching philosophy rankles the traditional faculty, inspires his students--such as Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) & Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke)-- and forever changes the landscape of the institution.

At heart, this film is an ode to non-conformist thinking and artistic endeavor, set in the perfect atmosphere and time in life (adolescence) to be rendered timeless. As long as schools still have classrooms where students gather together, ""Dead Poets Society"" will remain relevant thematically. That being said, it isn't overly saccharine or preachy. All of Keating's inspirational messages are very much portrayed in the context of the real world and its various shades of grey.

In terms of acting, one could make a case that this is the peak of Robin Williams' serious roles. His unstoppable energy breathes life into a role that could have been played by others--but to far less perfection. Simultaneously, the career of Hawke was launched here with his emotional portrayal of a young man caught in the middle of a newfound artistic passion and the realities of his real life. Those two standouts are also surrounded by a solid auxiliary cast--there's really not a bad performance here.

Does ""Dead Poets Society"" put a toe over the line of cheesiness a few times? Sure. That's probably why--even after multiple viewings--I can't quite give it the full 10/10 stars. But it has such a raw, youthful energy to it and espouses such a positive message for lovers of the performing arts that I consider it just a notch below that top mark. Whether you have witnessed the infamous scenes a thousand times or may be viewing them for the first time, it's a treat--that might just have you re-evaluating your life goals as the credits roll.",9
a trite scenario salvaged by its director,"Peter Weir took time off from an otherwise noteworthy career to direct this crowd-pleasing melodrama about yet another maverick schoolteacher with unorthodox methods, who in this instance bucks the traditions of his stuffy New England prep school by quoting Walt Whitman and inspiring his students to ""seize the day"". It's ironic that a script defending freethinking nonconformity should be so predictable, but under Weir's typically intelligent direction the film is (likewise predictably) never less than enjoyable. He pulls all the right strings in the right order, patching the familiar story together with a surplus of lush pictorial glue. Robin Williams downplays his trademark mugging style to actually offer a credible performance, despite being miscast (or at least misrepresented) in the pivotal lead role. Despite a few gratuitous moments of token stand-up comedy shtick (John Wayne and Marlon Brando impersonations, and so forth) it isn't, after all, meant to be a comedy.",7
Look under the teenage-targeted stuff,"Noam Chomsky once said that schools are there to train for stupidity, conformity and obedience. George Carlin in his famous routine about 10 commandments said that you could throw out the 4th commandment about obeying parents because it's simply there to make you respect authority without questioning so that you were easy to exploit by the elites. Besides, ""some parents deserve respect, most of them don't"".

Anyways, this movies gives an illustration. When I saw the word ""tradition"" on a school banner, I already got worried. But when it's ""tradition"", ""honor"" and ""discipline"", it's madness. Like, you have this 20th century around you (judging by the car models, the action takes place in the 1950s?) with scientific discoveries left and right, theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, rockets flying into outer space, and here is some boring institution singing praises to the Lord and teaching kids tradition and discipline. They claim to be the best school sending kids to the Ivy League universities. Does that include CalTech and MIT? I doubt that.

It's also interesting to see how many of the things that could have been possible in the 1950s stand out as almost impossible today. Like, this tyrannical father and the mother that is afraid to say a word and just keeps crying. Like, whaaaa? Why hasn't she divorced this idiot years ago? And the son who looks like he is 18 already (okay, 17, then it's one more year to wait) and is legally an adult. So, if he owns no part of the house, he if free to leave and can go wherever he wants, earn money himself with whatever he wants and become and actor or whatever he wants. He obviously has a talent for acting and gets standing ovations, so he should be fine. That's certainly better than to blow your brains out with a revolver. Then there is also a scene where a guy kisses a girl he loves while she is sleeping - by today's standards that not rape but still sexual harassment, see? She hasn't given consent.

The teacher is... well... certainly interesting. You rarely meet people like that in teaching. Because they would never fit the regulated, conformist and actually low-paying educational institutions that are mostly meant for mediocrities who couldn't find a better job in the corporate world or whatever. And the movie shows the guy promptly fired - which is a good thing! Creative people like this guy should not waste their time teaching. Instead, he should write great poems, publish them on Youtube, Amazon or whatever today's digital self-distribution platforms are, or maybe record travel blogs and give life advice to kids like Jordan Peterson, make it big on AdSense ads and then buy a Ferrari to prove to everyone how honesty, talent and non-conformism can thrive even in capitalism. He still would have to pay a 50% tax off that to Uncle Sam, but that's another story.

The movie touches on many important themes that are not easy to discuss because it quickly gets you into trouble with all kinds of people and organizations. The movies does it in a somewhat simplified, teenager-targeted way (as one negative review mentions). Yet the topic are deep, and there are multiple layers here if you want to see them. It's a statement that, even when you grow up and become ""wise"" and that rebellious youthful spirit and hormone-driven energy inside you die, the way to greatness (or simply just staying human, and not a shell of your past self) is to act independently.

Art dies when it becomes tradition. Art is all about novelty and innovation. Conformity and repetition kill art. That's why a bureaucratic teacher can only teach English (like, grammar and rules) but not poetry. Art is something a tyrant or a middle-class mediocrity can never grasp. In that, this movie will remain surprisingly relevant even 50 or 100 or 500 years later. Because mediocrity is the default, and will always be. Mediocrity is easy.",7
Better than I expected,"John Keating (Robin Williams) is the new English teacher at a public school in the USA. He has unorthodox teaching methods that inspire his pupils who then set up the ""Dead Poet's Society"", a society that Mr Keating was involved in when he was a student at the school. The idea is to meet up at night and recite poetry in order to free the mind and impress the ladies. We follow a handful of students as they try and do things their own way as inspired by Mr Keating but things go wrong.....

I was surprised that I enjoyed it. Robin Williams isn't his usual annoying self. In fact, it is Ethan Hawke who plays Todd that walks away with the most annoying character award. His character is very frustrating. There are a few unrealistic threads to the story, eg, a group of boys meeting up to read poetry at night - no way - boys sneak out to play football at night NOT to read poetry to each other. In real boarding schools, new kids are indoctrinated with humiliating rituals such as masturbating onto a piece of toast or a biscuit - they are not asked if they want to join a study group. But, then again, Americans are a different species. And no way would a pupil stand up in class and recite a poem about his love for a girl infront of his classmates just like a sissy! I also found that I didn't quite believe Neil's (Robert Sean Leonard) actions at the end of the film and as for the new boy, Todd, who knows his room-mate least out of everyone else, his reaction only makes sense if he is dealing with some gay issues.

However, there were some funny scenes and there were also some parts that make you think, eg, when the pupils are shown the pictures of previous pupils on the walls of the hallway - pupils who are now all dead.

This film is responsible for idiots saying ""Carpe Diem"". Its a bit long but its entertaining despite a downbeat end section.",6
Possibly the most inspiring film I've ever seen,"I saw ""Dead Poets Society"" for the first time last night. It was magical.

Every character, played to perfection by all actors, was very impressionable and very...real. Yes, they're poetic nerds, but it was still so easy for me to connect with not just one, but all of them. I understood their emotions and reasoning, and at the end of the movie, felt inspired ""to seize the day"". It really left me feeling that way.

Some people might feel like the end scene is a bit corny, but to me, it didn't feel corny, thankfully. To be honest, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the end, but I wasn't disappointed either. The majority of the film is light-hearted and easy-going, but it certainly does get darker and slightly depressing when it reaches the climax. The film doesn't feel as great in the aftermath of the climax, to me, since its really different from the rest of the film, but its not clichéd, and it still feels very real. But it just kind of puts the ""carpe diem"" thing to the side and replaces it with darkness, which is out of place. But that's what happens in real life.

When all is said and done, the power of the movie leaves you dazzled and inspired. I never felt more inspired and joyful at the end of a movie; this movie is that good. I don't know if I would say its one of the greatest films ever if you look at it from a technical and analytical point of view, but it is one of my favorites. Seize the day. How? Watch this film. Its great! 9.8/10",10
A tragical masterpiece,"Making us thinking about the concept of living but not living at all; how as human beings we somewhat feel lost like we are wasting our time. How it touched all of the things we go through in life without the movie feeling rushed nor forced. Youth and all what comes with it of difficulties of choosing between passion or ""success"". I think as a student I would have appreciated a teacher like Keating, that would try to get me out of my comfort zone and try to showcase all my talent, to confront me with my insecurities This movie is genius and the cast is absolutely perfect. It deserves a million stars review.",10
uplifting,"Revisiting Dead Poets' Society decades after first viewing, it is reassuring to see that it has not only lasted, but rewards with repeat viewing. A new English teacher at an elite boys' boarding school brings a maverick sense of teaching to the stuffy institution, injecting vitality into the life of some of the boys, while putting himself on a collision course with the school authorities. Great scenes abound: the walk in the courtyard to teach about the dangers of conformity, Tom's blindfolded poetry read, and the climactic tribute of the boys to their fallen captain, one of the greatest tear-jerkers in cinema. Look at Weir's angle and camera placement - absolutely perfect. His extreme wide shot of a grieving Tom in a snow landscape, and his silent depiction of Neil's demise, all attest to poetry in both script and mise-en-scene. Very few films are faultless, but there is not one word, shot, casting decision or any other element of this film that one would change. Outstanding cinema.",10
"Thank goodness for these kinds of men!!!!! (Men, Men, Yummy Men)","From script to casting to directing, editing, sound, setting, cinematography, performances -- this film is flawless. It's a movie I can watch again and again, already have and will watch it again with any new friend who wants to see it. It's a movie I will pay to see again. I would NEVER pirate this film -- that's despicable -- these artists deserve residual income! This story is fresh food to souls, hearts and minds dwindling in a world of zombies, vampires, bloodlust, phony masculinity, phony femininity, numbing avarice and over-the-top fashionistas.

Thank goodness for Walt Whitman and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for E. E. Cummings and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for Dr. Seuss and men who can be grateful for the sacred moments of reading his books to children.

Thank goodness for men who get that boys can become great men, regardless of how much muscle fiber is on their bones, or how little interest they have in sports. That words have power. Artistry is potent. Romance is courage.",10
Manipulative,"The first time I saw this movie, I was struck by its poetic quality, and the emotions it drew from me were surprising. The more I think about it, however, the more I realize how emotionally manipulative it is. The plot- especially in the last third of the film- seems contrived just to pull the maximum amount of irony, pathos, and tears from the viewer, when in fact it is really just artificial. The entire ending is meant to make the audience as mad as possible. It works every time I see it, even though I see through the trick.",6
Seize the Phrase,"Funny thing about this movie: I just think it's okay. It hits all the beats, the clichés, the heartstrings... but to me, it's just going through the motions to get through it.

No complaints and Williams did a fine job. Actually, all the actors did. If you liked this movie about finding your inner voice among conforming rules in a boarding school, so be it.

That's it. That's all I have to say. I only saw this once before, probably 25-28 years ago and felt the same back then. I added to the list now hoping it would inspire me, or I'd see it in a new light and rejoice!

Nope. I'm still: eh. Okay, seize the day - don't conform!

I'm way past that in my own life. I guess I have other past progressive people/teachers to thank for that. So. Thanks!",5
A brilliant classic film,"I love this movie! It has become a well-loved classic over the past decade. Robin Williams, perhaps one of the most under-rated actors of our time, is wonderful as the caring English teacher who reaches beyond the classroom to touch the lives of his students. It is the movie that inspired me to become an educator, and it still inspires me to try my hardest to reach even the unreachable. A must see!!",10
The movie that turned a novice of poetry into an avid proselyte,"Having procrastinated far too long and having kept this movie in the watchlist for years. I have finally brought myself to watch this film that is as beautiful as it is poignant and as empowering as it is moving.

Though I have rated numerous films over the years, this is my first written review on this app. I have always felt daunted by the much more intimidatingly long and detailed reviews left by the movie connoisseurs with all the pertinent film terminologies.

The acting was superb. Williams (Mr Keating) and Leonard (Neil) were outstanding. All the characters and every little detail, even those that did not have a line (including the boy that constantly rubs his nose with his white handkerchief ) were brilliantly written on screen by the writers. To my delight, there was little predictability, no over-the-top scenes, and thankfully no cringe-worthy moments.

As someone who had barely read a line of poetry, nor had known a thing about Byron, Thoreau or Tennyson (all poets whose names I had to search up again), the Dead Poets Society has converted me into a proselyte. Not merely a proselyte of remarkable poetry, but one who dares to dream, to pursue what he loves, and to inspire others as Keating inspires the class. In the face of growing opposition, in light of baseless opinions, in defiance of old-fashioned expectations and norms.

This film, from the moment it began, till the charged and iconic final scene, had me rapt, spellbound and inspirited. It has left an indelible mark and impression on me.",10
Oh Captain. My Captain.,"With the motto of tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence, the curriculum in this ""best preparatory school in the United States"" targets at pursuing students' high academic achievement, i.e., ""preparing them for college and the rest would take care of itself,"" using the school leader's words. On the contrary, Keating cares about ""the rest"": he uses unorthodox teaching methods in the classroom and teaches students to suck the marrow out of life. I love how Keating employs poems as his teaching methods. While connecting textbook content with real-world situation, these poems help his students dig deeper into his teaching topics like learning to think for themselves and trusting that your own beliefs are unique.

From the comparison between Keating's teaching and other teachers' teaching, this film reflects different purposes of education, portrays how knowledge for the curriculum is selected and organized differently, and discusses who should make curricular decisions. Take the last aspect as an example. The school principal tells Keating that ""the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same,"" and he forbids Keating to change the curriculum.",9
I can feel with the students,"Another time to watch a movie from 30 years ago. Why it is still fantastic? As a college student who often rewinds on her high school life, I can clearly feel with the students. Effects from one favourite teacher could be very big, even more when he's directly encouraging 'seize your day'. The students in the film do have different pursuits, and they also take tries to make them happen. The film doesn't give audience an answer how to realize your dreams, but it does inspire you to take actions at first before fertilizing daffodils. I first heard about this film in my English class, now it's been a year then I finally get to watch it. Appreciate.",9
Oh Captain my Captain Ode to those that shape us,My personal watch of this movie left me reminiscing on the times in which the pressure of expectations of those around me have left me with similar feelings as the characters depicted. I myself am an actor and the feeling that I cannot be myself in order to fit into the standards of those I love is something I am quite familiar with. But this movie always reminds me of who has brought me this far and allowed me to be who I am now. My own Captain being my sister who though I don't see often is always on my side. We all have a Captain in our lives and this piece of cinema allows us to remember them through the eyes of the characters in this film lovely movie and I highly recommend.,6
Inspiring story.,It seems quite outdated nowadays and its faults are not to be overlooked but I guess it still has some powerful elements.,8
Ok film but to serious,"Ok film, but PC before PC started. They blame the death of a crazy student on the teacher. Not very funny film, and depressing to watch. It is a well made film. Would I watch it for entertainment value no. 7/10",7
Don't even waste your time,"Oh boy. What to say about this movie. I rushed to watch it because of the rave reviews...someone even said it changed their life completely. Are you kidding me? Me and my entire family watched it and they all hated me at the end of the night. We were all even grunting loud complaints all throughout the movie about how bad it is. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Robin Williams is obnoxious in this one, the characters don't have much personality or development, and nothing ever really happens. And, please, you don't learn a thing about poetry, not even about anything. This movie is pointless. I wasn't inspired at any time during the movie, and neither was anyone in my family who was watching it with me. We were all just lost, thinking, ""What's going on now? Huh? How does this all fit together?""",1
On my personal Top 10,"While I love movies of all shapes and sizes, there are a few movies that stand out among the rest. Dead Poets Society is one such movie. It doesn't hurt that Robin Williams is one of my favorite performers, either. This film came out during the summer before my first year at Indiana University and gave me some much needed confidence and inspiration as I started a new chapter in my life. I still go back to this film when I'm feeling a little down or if I need a kick in the pants. All in all, if you have not seen this film yet - please rent it (or buy it) - and soak up the wonderful story.",10
"Captain, My Captain!","""Dead Poets Society"" is an American drama movie about a school, where rules, tradition and discipline are the main columns. When the school gets a new english teacher, everything changes, and the students learn to think independent and think bigger. This movie is probably one of the most clever movies I have ever seen. The things they are saying, the poems they're reading, is something that activate your brain. The dialogues and the readings were fantastic, very wise quotes and very rememberable. Sometimes it was hard to understand everything at the first shot, but I understood that later. The music soundtrack was very nice, quiet and matched the scenes really good, matched like two memory pieces. The whole idea of the movie was very clever, and it took up many things that people don't use to talk about, what I think was good and important in here. But the acting was absolutely outstanding! Especially Robin Williams. He played good in all of the movies I have seen him in, but in this one, he played so real. If this movie was reality, I would think he really was a teacher, because he played so good that you could think he was a teacher. Beside him, the teenagers played fantastically, too. With such feeling and dynamic, absolutely amazing. To summary, Dead Poets Society was a very good movie, very wise and clever, fantastically made, and deserves a full rating, because of the amazing things and cleverness it had. I recommend it for everyone who like a movie that is more focused on message than action.",8
Seize the day,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a timeless film that leaves a lasting impact on its audience. Directed by Peter Weir, the story unfolds in a traditional New England boarding school during the late 1950s.

Robin Williams delivers a captivating performance as John Keating, an English teacher who defies convention with his unorthodox teaching methods. With his blend of wit, wisdom, and vulnerability, Williams brings depth to the character, making Keating a memorable and inspiring figure.

The film explores themes of conformity, tradition, and the pursuit of passion, as Keating encourages his students to embrace individuality and seize the day. Williams' portrayal of Keating resonates with authenticity, drawing viewers into the transformative journey of the students under his guidance.

While the entire cast delivers strong performances, Williams stands out with his magnetic presence and heartfelt portrayal. His ability to infuse the character with warmth and humor makes Keating a beloved mentor figure for both the characters in the film and the audience.

""Dead Poets Society"" is a poignant reminder of the importance of embracing one's passions and challenging societal norms. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, thanks in large part to Robin Williams' exceptional performance.",10
"Great characters, terrible ending.","This film is dramatic, fun and filled with eye opening quotes. It mainly focuses on wholesome relationships between friends and a teacher in robin williams that is fun loving and hilarious. Not much happens through out the film and there isn't any real problem to be solved which can leave you bored if your not invested enough. The ending of this film is utterly terrible and without giving anything away it is just so incredibly unsatisfying. As the viewer watching someone get suppressed and then having the ""baddies"" win in the end but also not having learned any lesson at all. What a god awful ending to a slow film that builds up to let you down.

Summary: This film is slow but has really great characters, wholesome moments and performances. But gets let down hugely by a lack of a driven goal and a God awful ending that is a slap in the face to the viewer. I'd only reccomend this if your a hardcore robin williams fan and like slow philosophical films.",6
"Intense, one of a kind, experience","Very touching drama about the moral value on which most of us sees as irrelevant.Dead Poets Society is no more, no less than a masterpiece, along with ""Back to the Future"" the best 80's creation, and another proof of Peter Wier's gigantic talent.

The story focuses on life experience, as seen from inside a group of students, an experience which radically changes, one they meet Mr. Keating, the new English teacher. With time, he encourages them to live the moment (carpe diem), to see beyond the materialism, the pleasures of adolescence and introduces them in the world of poetry and deep meanings. However, it seems not everyone appreciates the teacher's attempt, and problems don't cease to occur, in a very dramatic end, which leaves you with quite a bitter taste, I might add.

The acting was at its brightest. From Robin Williams I expected nothing less than impressive, because I've always considered him to be, one of the most skilled actors, here making no exception as Professor Keating, a sensitive man who experiences happiness through poetry, a sincere and altruist person who fervently wants to share his beloved passion with his much younger students.

The real surprise was the performance of Robert Sean Leonard (Wilson from House MD TV series ) impersonating Neil Perry, a boy who loves acting but can't follow his dream because of his father's wish, as if his opinion didn't count at all, as if his personality was literally caged.

This is actually the meaning of this title, the misery and suffering of not being able to do what you like most... even if that doesn't suit your parents. Dead Poets Society insists on the differences between people, shows us that what some brave people built with passion and warmth can be destroyed by others incompetence and primitivism.

The world imagined by Wier, to whom I sincerely thank for crafting this beautiful film, is a divided one, always in the middle of a twister,a hurricane or what any other word you can think of, a non-stop tiresome conflict of interests.

To conclude, Dead Poets Society, is a title of unique atmosphere, beautiful acting samples, and last but not least, masterly directing. It's like a french wine, it gets better and better, as time goes on.

All being said I rate this title a ***** out of *****",10
Sad movie except for Alan Pottinger's performance.,"Mr Keating, a school teacher in a elite private school, uses his position to pursue a political agenda, namely to liberalize the school's curriculum, with tragic results. To achieve his political goals, the teacher encourages his students, all impressionable adolescents, to break the rules of the school, under the guise of promoting academic and personal freedom, and a group of his students respond by forming a secret society. These students have no idea that Mr. Keating is using them to promote strife between the faculty and student body, embarrass the school administration and thereby force change. As a result the students are placed in impossible conflictual situations that they are utterly incapable of resolving. Mr. Keating's manipulativeness is so blatantly reckless that it leads to one student committing suicide. Perhaps if Mr. Keating had communicated his concerns through appropriate administrative channels without involving the students, things would have worked out differently. But if that had happened, then there wouldn't have been a movie.

One bright point in this otherwise somber movie is Alan Pottinger's high-spirited and upbeat performance as ""Bubba"" the high-school jock.",7
my favorite movie,"I lost count of how many times i watched this movie and i cry everytime. This movie leaves me with hope for the future but at the same time i feel empty, like something was taken away from me. This movie gives me a lot of different feelings and it will be forever my comfort movie. I loved the story, the way it was filmed and the message that it tries to give other people. I love the poetry of this movie. This movie is a masterpiece and i think it's one of the best movies ever made (it's obviously my opinion). This movie had such an impact on my life and i consider it the best life lesson that i could ever get (sorry if my english isn't perfect, it's not my first language)",10
An overrated movie,"This movie is pretty much a mess. I'm a huge Peter Weir fan, and I really expected more from him. If you want to see one of his films, rent Gallipoli or Picnic at Hanging Rock, and avoid this at all costs. This is basically one of those tiresome, pseudo-inspirational films wherein a unique, rule-breaking teachers inspires his students to do their own thing. The characters are all cliches - the teacher; the sweet, slightly effeminate boy with the obnoxious father who doesn't understand him; the token girlfriend character, etc. Also, I'm sick of Robin Williams using his films as a forum to show off his impersonations - save those for the stand-up routines.",3
WOW - Watch this!,"That said, it doesn't have a happy ending....this is a really well crafted film which is about the relationship between a group of privileged boys in a top notch school and their new English teacher (Robin Williams)....the head master is quite vile (Think: ""Im in charge""!)....and some of the boys parents can only be politely described as ""tyrants""....if I said more than that I would spoil it for you. We have just watched this during lockdown and apart from several times shouting at the screen, due to the injustices, it really a well presented and should be watched. I would have liked a happier ending, but that isn't what this film is actually about - watch it, see what you think - highly recommended. the Boys are all superb as is Robin Williams",9
Great,A very emotional movie filled with wonderful performances and interesting themes that captures perfectly the insecurities (and joys) of growing up.,8
Neat movie that shows much unfairness.,"Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Green Card, Witness) has done many good movies, and I always look forward to seeing his latest work. ""John Keating"" Robin Williams (What Dreams May Come) inspires his students toward free thinking and poetry. One the students had a father who did not have a clue about understanding his son's emotional needs causes the kid to commit suicide. Not taking responsibility for his own actions, the father incites the school head master to get rid of the professor. That was the sad part to me because in other boarding school movies such as: Circle of Friends, Scent of a Woman (at least partially a boarding school movie) the good wins, while in the Dead Poets the teacher gets fired. I did not like that unfair side of it. The kids do make a statement against the firing but primarily the bad guys win, at least that is my perception. The teacher wanted to inspire the students, not the stuffy headmaster, and in that he succeeded.

I liked the fact that in this movie we have boys interested in poetry and not girls, which breaks some stereotypes. I enjoyed the movie. The cinematography is pretty. Ethan Hawke was a cute young adult when this movie was made. Favorite Scenes: The kids meeting at night in their secret place. The boys memorizing poetry on their own. John Keating, stepping on the desk: ""We must look at things in a different perspective."" Favorite Quotes: ""Four disciplines: Brilliance, honor, discipline, excellence."" Professor John Keating: ""Seize the day""; ""Words and ideas can change the world.""; ""Strive to find your voice""; ""We are not laughing at you. We are laughing near you."" I think that Julliard graduate Robin Williams has proven to be one great and versatile actor, and no small wonder he is an Oscar winner. He has played many parts that are completely outside of the scope of his funny self.",7
One of my favourite movies,"Undoubtedly one of my favorits movies. It's an incredibly thought-provoking movie, especially for those who yearn for something deeper in life. Few movies capture the essence of poetry as powerfully as this one. It leaves you with profound reflections and an irresistible urge to think freely and challenge societal norms.

It also addresses the tragedy of living according to others' expectations and the heartbreak that comes from letting someone else dictate your dreams. This part adds to its emotional depth and overall greatness.

Lastly, I can't imagine a more fitting actor for the role of Mr. Keating than Robin Williams. His performance is extraordinary, such a brilliant actor that leaves you with a warmth within.

Couldn't help but shed tears at the ending.",8
Good movie,Good movie showcased how education should be done. It inspires people to pursue their meanings of life.,7
Good classic Robin film,"The film is mainly the story of two students in his class Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. Leonard is a shy kid and Hawke is a popular one. But Hawke is not from a wealthy family. His father Kurtwood Smith has made many sacrifices to get him into that prep school. Hawke wants to be an actor and Williams says follow your dream. Their clash sets in motion the dramatic events of the climax.

Dead Poet's Society won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director as well. Williams got a nomination for Best Actor. Dead Poet's Society maybe set in the 50s, but it expresses a universal theme about always question the status quo until you get a satisfying answer.",7
A Shell of Profundity--Please watch it again...It's not as good as you thought,"First, let me recommend Roger Ebert's review on this movie--he generally sums up the problems I have with it. The great American poet Wallace Stevens (who thankfully does not join the list of other great poets bastardised by this movie) wrote many aphorisms in his journals which were published posthumously; in one of those aphorisms he poignantly claimed that ""sentimentality is the failure of feeling."" Dead Poet's Society is cloyingly sentimental. I wince at so many moments: references made to poems that the writers evidently had no deep connection with, scenes contrived for the sole purpose of providing Robin Williams with a stage for his stand-up comedy jokes and impressions, and a suicide motivated by formulaic and totally un-compelling issues. Please watch it again...It's not as good as you thought.",5
William's Class Act,"One of the finest film I've come a crossed recently. Although watching it in 2020 makes its plot very familiar with Unorthodox teacher inspiring his students to make their lives extraordinary by the phrase Carpe Diem i.e. seize the day and on the contrary parents having different plans and ambitions for their children's, yet the brilliant narration and picturization makes it different from other movies still in 2020 with same idea which you'll definitely agree after watching this movie . Peter Weir's storytelling is very engaging followed by some catchy background score which ignites the emotions instantly especially in the climax scene. Robin Williams as John Keating, the Teacher narrating poetries and making it relevant to the common life struggles etc. is just brilliant, by the end of the movie you'll definitely sympathize for the character and chances are you might actually end up with tears just as I did and that defines the sheer class of Late Robin Williams. Supporting cast i.e. the young group of students at that time not so young today were very convincing, they nailed it with their own stories and things happening around them and their connection with their teacher who once freaked them out. Despite of some hell of the performances and smart direction, film's strongest part is indeed its writing and credit should've been given to Tom Schulman, actually credit has already been given to him as he secured Academy Award for this movie, Although the plot is familiar in 2020 but imagine 1989 when film got released pitching this kind of story for the first time ........ In the end I would conclude it by stating that film is thought provoking and hits you hard with its idea and emotional notion which it creates convincingly within 2hour and 10mins of its run time.",8
A Fantastic Film.,"The Man Without a Face was apparently Mel Gibson's directorial debut in 1993, and established his pattern of directing and starring in his own films. It's based on a book of the same name, but I have not read it so I won't address that, only the film itself.

I think the film is brilliant. The story is complex, the characters and their backgrounds and motivations deep and well-realized. They all feel like real people. The setting is wonderfully captured.

The performances, even from the supporting cast, are outstanding, particularly where they require a fair bit from child actors, who even appear to be about the correct ages. Mel Gibson's performance is masterful, as usual, but so is the young Nick Stahl's.

I watched this more than 30 years after the film's release, and it has lost nothing. The story and themes are timeless. The best comparison I could give this film is Dead Poets Society (1989), which is itself high praise, because that film was also fantastic. They both shine in different ways, but I suppose I'd have to admit I think DPS is probably the superior film, though not by much. If you liked DPS, you will almost certainly like this as well. Regardless, I very highly recommend this film.",8
Rhyme and Reason,"It was a different World in 1959 and Teaching Conventions and Learning Institutions were Ultra Conservative, especially by Today's Standards. The Film takes place at an Uppity Prep School with Traditions not easily toppled. Enter Free Thinking Teacher Mr. Keating who is about to ""Shake Rattle and Roll"".

This is a, dare one say it, Poetic Movie with a smooth Patina and an Off-Beat Meter. But, ironically it stays quite standard in its portrayal of Student Rebellion and is nowhere near Kerouac, Ginsberg, or The Beats. Some reference or acknowledgment of ""The Movement"" might have been a bit closer to the Theme here and would have given it some Street Cred.

This is by the Book, pretty much, with its often visited Story and is not without Flaws. Such as the completely out of context Page Ripping Scene that is so badly thought out that it almost makes the Movie Dumb Ass. Did the Writer actually think that Censorship and Book Destruction was an apt way to illustrate Free Thinking. That is unforgivable.

An overrated Film, but a Very Good one. Schools were like that, Parents were like that, it is an Inconvenient Truth. In the Decade that followed, for better or worse (mostly better), conventions would collapse, traditions would tumble, and the Lip Service given to Freedom would be challenged. In this Fictional Story, all that was a little ahead of its Time and those involved suffered, like all Dissidents.",7
O Captain! My Captain!,"Directed by Peter Weir from an original screenplay written by Tom Schulman, Dead Poets Society is a coming-of-age drama released in 1989. Some of you who read this probably already knew who Robin Williams was but if you don't and haven't watched any of his movies, this is a perfect introduction. You'll end up wishing that he was your English teacher at school rather than whoever it was who taught you, and I assure you, you'll never find a movie with a narrative that relates to us, students, so much as Dead Poets Society is.

You know what, I've watched this movie before and decided that it was enough because I don't want to go through all of it again. As much as I like the movie, I just hate how it makes me feel after I finish watching. It's kind of a rollercoaster of emotions really. But here I am, having watched it for the second time just for the sake of writing this very review. I'm not sure if it's the writer's intention, but I think Dead Poets Society is pretty much a social commentary on every conventional school system that we know of out there. You see, teachers, particularly in school, have pretty much the exact same methods of teaching as if it were like a written rule that must be followed. Sometimes, they never let the students think freely for themselves, and the teachers wouldn't even attempt to make the lesson feel exciting. Through Williams's character Keating, the writer subtly tells us that he's exactly the kind of teacher we need. Well, John Keating is indeed the man; he guides us to chase the things that we want or our passion but can't because we are only told what to chase, and if we chase something as we please, it's wrong. Speaking of wrong, he also wants us to find our own ""walk"" no matter what others might say, to maintain our own in the face of conformity.

I have only seen a handful of movies out of his entire filmography, so I wouldn't necessarily call myself a big fan of Robin Williams, but watching this movie again reminds me of what makes him one of my favorite actors (I surely need to watch more of his work). He always poured his heart out on each role, that's why he also seems very passionate about the character he portrayed. I mean, if you told me whether he was acting or not in this movie, I wouldn't even have known about it. I love how the writer sets the movie to take place during two different seasons, autumn and then we moved to winter, at the end of the movie. Because I think it fits the overall tone and symbolizes a character or also the state of things after a tragedy occurs. Autumn is a perfect use of symbolism for the character of John Keating. He's giving this sense of warmth like none other to his students, they feel free and safe at the same time. To them, he's more than just a teacher; he's the captain or even perhaps a father figure they should have for some boys. The visuals and cinematography of this movie are just gorgeous; it's a feast for the eyes, and they capture the beauty of autumn perfectly. You might say it's an oversimplification, well, because It is simple and beautiful.

I don't care if you don't like a dialogue-driven drama; you must at least watch this kind of movie once in your life. Because It can change you, well, it does for me at least.",9
"The poetry of the ""Dead Poets Society""","Dead Poets Society is a beautiful drama movie that won the Best Screenplay Academy Award in 1989. The movie was written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is graduated in philosophy and because of this the screenplay presents important reflections about the life.

Robin Williams interprets John Keating, the new English teacher of a traditional school. The difference between John Keating and the other teachers of this school is the way he uses the English poetry to inspire his students to create and think by themselves. In the first class, he talked about ""Carpe Diem"", a Latin expression that means seize the day.

John Keating is an important character, but the students are the focus of the plot. The poetry change the relationship between themselves and their families. Some students who were oppressed by their parent plans and expectations stars to plan their own dreams and to live their own loves.

The Dead Poets Society is like an art and philosophy's manifest. It is a sensitive and necessary movie to be watched in nowadays. The utilitarian ideology doesn't recognizes the value of the poetry, the romance and the love, but these things give meaning and purpose to our lives, help us to see the world in a different way. We can't live without it!",10
"A slow, somber, and impactful film","Dead Poets Society is a film that has ingrained itself in popular culture. Certain phrases and moments have continued to echo through the air years after it was released. Robin Williams really is the shining star of this movie, as his warmth and passion for learning make him the teacher everyone wants to have. However, much like poetry, Dead Poets Society may not appeal to some. It's a slow and somber film, with only brief moments of slight levity provided by Williams, and it can definitely sway into the melodramatic. Still, it's an impactful story, and it stays with you long after you watch it.",7
"Brilliant. Individualism, years ahead of its time.","Dead Poets Society to me was just brilliant. The obvious being the amazing Robin Williams, truly great performance with a perfect balance between a comedic tone with a powerful but subtle voice. All the other actors were great also, having kids be the focul point in movies isn't always a hit but it seems back in the 80s casting was more thorough. They were all great, my favourite of the characters being Charlie Dalton, ""I'm exercising my right not to walk"". Fantastic.

Without revealing spoilers, this film is not just about coming of age or rebelling against the system. A big take away for me was the story of how a great and passionate teacher can touch so many but not all of the students. How reaching and understanding young adults at such a tender age can have huge impact on their current and future lives. Shaping the men they are to become.

An utterly brilliantly written story, each line of script was crafted just as eloquently as the poems they recite.",8
So... all parents are bad?,"Writing 2 dimensional parents into a story about poets, writing, passion and self identity... it's such a good adaptation, but all parents are horrible in it.",7
Still worth another look,"It's set in 1959 in an elite private boys boarding school in Vermont. The ethos is strict and conservative, and the school is seen as a launch pad to Ivy League schools. Some of the students' parents are wealthy while other families have to sacrifice to get their sons into the school.

John Keating (Robin Williams), an alumnus of the Welton Academy, is the new English teacher. He comes with fresh ideas, symbolized by the way he invites students to explore poetry. His students include Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a popular student with a passion for acting, though his father insists he become a physician. Neil's roommate is Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a shy student whose older brother was a prize student at the school. Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston) are other members of the gang. Headmaster Gale Nolan (Norman Lloyd) tries hard to preserve the traditional ways.

The students learn Keating was part of a ""Dead Poets Society"" when he was a student at Welton. They create their own DPS based on Keating's model, meeting in a cave some distance from campus late at night. They read poetry, but generally commit to self-expression in their gatherings.

A tragedy inevitably takes place with profound consequences for all involved.

I was moved by this film when I saw it back in the day, and I still found it impactful in this viewing. I do believe the Robin Williams character gets off pretty lightly for the bad advice he gives Neil Perry, especially given what he knows about Neil's family situation. Neil's father, Thomas (Kurtwood Smith), is over-the-top as a stereotype of a rigid kind of 1950s dad.

But ""Dead Poets Society"" is still worth another look.",7
A film every parent should see!,"'Dead Poets Society' is one of the top rated films of all-time and also happens to be a multi-award winning film, and its easy to see why. This is a truly remarkable film every parent, especially, should see. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are exceptional in their respective roles. In fact, the entire cast were very good, and notably also Ethan Hawke.

The love story between Knox and Chris felt forced and was annoying and seemingly out of place in this film. Yes, I understand the need to portray young love, since this is a coming of age film, but there was nothing romantic about them. I found it to be pure lust on Knox's behalf and Chris eventually fell for him for whatever reason. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them and the film would have been so much better without this love interest. Charlie Dalton's obsession with women was far more believable and (also) clearly lust, but suited the character and emphasized his personality.

Robin Williams played a very gentle, kindhearted character, always giving advice and putting everyone else's needs before his own. He not only captures the student's attention, but also the viewer's, as he is perceived as a caring, loving person and me as the viewer felt a sense of joy as he nurtured the boys, giving them hope and inspiration - not only on a poetic level, but on life itself. It was delightful to see the boys enjoy his class and looking forward to what he had to offer.

The unexpected ending shocked me to the core, for so many different reasons, and I won't spoil it for you. It caught me completely off guard. Although this is a film I probably won't watch again in a hurry (especially now that I know the ending) it definitely is a film worth viewing at least once.",8
"A Heartfelt Tribute to Robin Williams and the Power of 'Carpe Diem'""","Dead Poets Society is a film that speaks to the heart, exploring themes of authenticity, friendship, and the importance of living fully. Robin Williams, with his unparalleled talent, brings to life a character who embodies the spirit of ""carpe diem""-seize the day-in such a way that it feels both inspiring and deeply personal. Watching it today, I can't help but think about how much we miss him. His performance reminds me of the kind of joy and passion for life that he brought to the world.

It's heartbreaking to think that a man who preached to live fully didn't get to do so for himself. His absence feels even more profound after watching this movie-a beautiful, touching reminder of how much we lost. Dead Poets Society isn't just a story of inspiration, it's a bittersweet reflection on how we wish Robin Williams could still be here, living his own ""carpe diem.""",7
Dead creativity society,"This movie was a blockbuster and it's sure easy to see why.It's got a nice ,vapid ,""moving"" screenplay ,with enough demagogy to win over the White House.You cannot be wrong when you show a nice ,modern,likeable,teacher.Is there anybody to tell me why cool teachers are always lit teachers?Look at the maths teacher:he's so grotesque that only naive people will bother.It sure is easier to tear out pages from a literature book:after all,you can study Thomas Hardy before Edgar Allan Poe ,who cares?Or use a ""method"" of your own.But try to study,say,the differential equations before the exponential fonction!

This Poetic Outburst against Academic Oppress deserved Oscar more than Driving Miss Daisy..,"Dead Poet's Society (1989) : Brief Review -

This Poetic Outburst against Academic Oppress deserved Oscar more than Driving Miss Daisy. Dead Poet's Society is just not a Classic Cinematic experience but it has more to bring change and evolution in Student's life who are under terrific academic pressure. A Maverick teacher John Keating arrives in strict and disciplined boarding schood and uses poetry to embolden his students to new heights of self-expression and find thier verses. Robin Williams plays the teacher that we all wish to have at least for one seminar in our lives. His poetic thoughts are so intellectual and subversive. I wouldn't mind having such a teacher for the period of lifetime. Dead Poet's Society is also about desires and passion of Teenage boys. What they want to do in this life and how they were pressurised to do what thier parents want them to do so that they will have a sophisticated name in this civilised society. The message is important for every single soul who lives in this crazy circus called The World. Acting by Robin Williams is good but surprisingly the students i mean all them are even better. Ethan Hawke, Robert Leonard, Gale Hansen, Josh Charles look like students, they behave as one and even the rest of the cast is highly supporting. There are couple of things missed and left incomplete in the film but those were very little things so can be forgiven. Peter Weir makes a Brilliant and indulging film but more importantly he gave the right direction to outburst and to the emotions in the cilmax. I wouldn't cared about that Dead Poet's Society meeting thing set in the Cave much if it had emotions overshadowed by it. If audience voting mattered then Dead Poet's Society deserved Best Picture Oscar more than Driving Miss Daisy and i am saying with firm belief.

RATING - 8/10*

Just great,"In the late 1960s, John Keating (Robin Williams) comes to teach at a prestigous prep school. His unconventional teaching ways (and his telling them to ""carpe diem""--seize the day) have some strong effects on his students--in particular; Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) who hates the school; Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is helplessly in love with a girl; Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) who is painfully shy and Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor despite his father's (Kurtwood Smith) refusal. This all leads to a predictable conclusion.

Let's get my complaints out of the way--the story is predictable (how it won an Oscar for Best Screenplay is beyond me) and the tragic turn late in the story is really not needed. I also didn't believe the final sequence for one second. Also I kept getting the feeling that this was made just to win Oscars. That aside, this is a great film.

It IS predictable but still is well-written, well-acted and well-directed. Williams (justly nominated for Best Actor) is great. He tones down his usual over the top personality and underplays his part very nicely. The teaching sequences with his students are great--a really good one was when he teaches Hawke how to ""write"" a poem. Also his ""carpe diem"" became a catch phrase for years afterwords. Hansen is also very good as Dalton as is Charles as Overstreet. Hawke (who i usually hate) was surprisingly good as Anderson and Leonard is just exceptional as Perry--every time he was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off him. He's one hell of an actor. Also Smith is totally evil as a domineering father. Basically, nobody is bad and they say all their lines with conviction. Even though I saw everything coming I didn't care--the acting was so good I couldn't stop watching.

The direction by Weir is great. Two sequences stand out--when Williams is teaching Hawke about the poem and when three of the boys are chasing each other around a room. Also there are some really beautiful sequences such as the winter ones and when the boys go out in the dead of night for ""society"" meetings. Incidentally Dead Poets Society is the boys getting together in a cave late at night and reading poetry or telling tall tales to each other. Sounds strange, but it works in the context of the movie.

I'm giving this a 10--I just wish I could get rid of those lingering doubts about WHY this picture was made...I wish it was for the story and the acting, but I don't think it was.",10
My favorite movie I've ever watched,"There haven't been very movies that I genuinely feel changed my life, and Dead Poets Society is most definitely one of them. This movie really made me understand the importance of living by the phrase ""carpe diem."" I think all of the guys in Dead Poets Society are relatable to many in their own way, which I think is one of the reasons why this is such a widely adored film; people can see how someone can struggle to live life to the fullest, but they wish to do so anyway. Todd Anderson was my favorite character. I really related to him in terms of his anxious personality, but in the end, learning to be comfortable in himself and his own decisions. I think Neil Perry is extremely relatable to the masses due to his ""unrealistic"" dreams. I've known so many people, and have also myself, wanted unrealistic realities. I think that both these characters are really important to both myself and for so many people, especially adolescents. I think it's important to learn how to embrace yourself, the draw backs to doing it, and the drawbacks to not doing it. I think this film can really inspire some people to live the life they always wanted, and to really embrace the meaning of carpe diem.",10
Why this movie is NOT another bad Robin Williams showcase,"Robin Williams has played a doctor, another doctor, a disk jockey, a toymaker, a loony scientist, and so on through a long list - each character somehow different from everyone else in his profession, each with a certain something that makes everyone else adore him, each obviously in possession of a huge ego, each given an opportunity to do some Robin Williams schtick, each determined to steal the movie at all costs. He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?

It's fourfold:

(1) Peter Weir is far from being my favourite director - he's capable of pretentious turkeys like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", for one thing - but he's not a hack. Weir makes it worth watching in a number of ways other than those mentioned below.

(2) If you see through the Cult of Williams and notice things which escape its adherents (Keating really IS a poor English teacher; the chapter he urges his students to tear out of their books is saying perfectly sensible things and at any rate, it's a strange thing to tell them to do under the guise of getting them to ""think for themselves""; the hero-worship the students indulge in IS disturbing and unhealthy), it doesn't matter. The central story concerns the student Neil and how he acquires moral courage. It works as a story whatever attitude we take or ought to take towards Mr. Keating. The film is NOT just , ""Why Robin Williams is right and everyone else is wrong.""

(3) The villains ... actually, there aren't really any villains, and of the teachers who oppose Mr. Keating, one, at least, is both sensible and sympathetic. Robin Williams has true counterweights.

(4) Robin Williams does not sweep all before him in a wave of triumph. What triumph there is muted and limited in scope. Trust me: that's exactly what you want in this movie. The last thing you want to see is the Cult of Keating taking over the world.

""Dead Poets Society"" is a fine movie so long as not too much is claimed for it. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: if you're under sixteen when you first see this movie and you don't feel that it will change your life, you have no heart; if you're over sixteen when you see it and you still feel that it will change your life, you have no head.

I was sixteen exactly. That lets me off the hook.",7
Dynamite work,"I love Robin Williams and this is probably his most meaningful role. He brings life to the teaching profession. I think it's fair to say that Robin Williams touched those kids as both an actor and in his role as a teacher.

The boys were all excellent in their roles. Very memorable and often times funny.

The ending is tragic and definitely breaks your heart. But it is worth the watch.",10
Iconic,"God this film is still so strong in this day of age. It's sad rewatching Robin Williams and seeing how talented of a performer he was. He truly was an icon of his time and has given a number of important performances. It's also fun to re-watch this movie and see performance from the younger actors like Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Gale Hansen. It's interesting to see how their careers progressed.

I think that any young boy can find themselves in the cast of those films even if you did not attend a private school. There are universal themes in this film that I think every young boy going through high school experiences.",7
Good except for the Nazi propaganda in the film,"***Contains spoilers***

""Dead Poets Society"" is a beloved film about an unorthodox teacher who struggles to free the hearts of his prep-school pupils. It is a touching, inspiring movie that I would have given a 10, if not for excess of Nazi propaganda.

Only recently did I notice that there are no Jews, homosexuals, Slavic people, African-Americans, gypsies, or openly-homosexual characters in the movie. In fact, the society is one of racial purity and heteronormativity, and this is very troubling for anyone who cares about diversity.

So what is the movie really about? It's about an Aryan uberman named John Keating who shows up to liberate a bunch of passive, girly boys from their headmaster overlord. He demands utter fealty, and tells his students they must be proud of who they are (i.e., caucasian and privileged).

Even the arts and culture website The Dandy Goat has an interview about this, with both the screenwriter and Peter Weir, the director, saying the goal of the film was to give rise to a Fourth Reich.

In the original script, Keating even shows up in a German WWII Panzer tank to destroy the school.

Sheesh, so much for innocence in movies.",7
Very cheesy,"This is the WORST movie I've ever seen.

Forget Waterworld, Wild Wild West or Battlefield Earth, this movie has everything I hate in a movie. First of all, Robin Williams making drama. God save us!! Always very sappy (I only liked him in Good Will Hunting). Cheesy dialogue. Sappy scenes (some scenes were so sappy I had to look away). Bad acting. Bad plot? Well, I don't even think this thing (I don't even call it a movie) has a plot. Ooohh and of course, it's BORING. I think that's the best adjective that describes this thing. BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING. Did I mention it was BORING?",1
"Believe it or not, it really was like that in 1959","I attended a military school in 1962. Aside from the military aspects. It was no different than Welton. They demanded conformity. They told everyone what they wanted them to think, and how to behave. I hated just about every minute that I was there, which fortunately was less than one school year. I later served in the real military -- remember, this is when there was still a Draft. Military school was nothing like the ""real thing"". While I found this film to be too slow-paced at times, it is still well worth watching. Some of the most chilling performances are by the the ""bad guys"", specifically those portrayed by Norman Lloyd and Kurtwood Smith. The story certainly explains why the 60's experienced such a profound social revolution. That was the Baby Boomer Generation -- which later turned its back on much it had struggled to change. ""Deja Vu all over again"".",8
Fantastic,"Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, and Walt Whitman ... that's a trinity I can get behind. This is such a beautiful, stirring film to me. The messages of carpe diem, of finding the beauty in the poetry of the world, and of expressing oneself instead of conforming to others are profound, and I could watch the unconventional teaching methods all day.

The central struggles are of a student (Robert Sean Leonard) trying to pursue his dream in spite of a domineering father, another (Josh Charles) trying to win a young woman's heart in spite of how unrealistic it seems, and a third (Hawke) trying to find his voice in spite of his introversion and having grown up in the shadow of his very successful older brother. All of them are trying to get through prep school, but a new teacher makes them see the world and path they're on a little bit differently. Director Peter Weir told this story very well and got every bit of emotion out of it.

The film hits me even harder because I once had a teacher in the same vein as John Keating (Robin Williams). It was for a class called Prose Literature, one that I found myself in completely by accident, and which ended up being the most influential class in my life. After what I thought was a fantastic year, the teacher ran afoul of conservative school officials, got fired, and the case eventually went to court, where I and some other students were called to testify. We stood up for him, perhaps not as dramatically as that extraordinary 'O Captain, My Captain' moment in this film, and he was acquitted/reinstated. I'm not sure where he is now in this world, but this film makes me wish I could tell him how important he was to me.",10
Excellent story and superb direction...,"1st watched 4/7/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Peter Weir): Excellent story and superb direction by Weir make this drama work. There have been many movies about teacher's who relate to their students in greater ways than what normally is expected but this one is more about the students than the teacher. Robin Williams plays a new English teacher for a very high-brow preparatory school and doesn't follow the book to teach his kids. He emphasizes that they ""Sieze"" every day because it may be their last and teaches them how poetry is about passion of life rather than just a subject in school. Some of the students grab a-hold of his teaching and form a secret soceity that reads poetry in a scary cave near the school. The philosophy bleeds into their lives and starts to reek havic on their normal everyday lives but they for once are truly learning about themselves and learning from their life experiences. A tragedy occurs with one of the students and this is where the story takes a turn and life starts to be the judge as to whether the students really believe what they think they do. Excellent performances and a compelling story keep you involved with the characters till the end. In my opinion, the ending left a lot to be desired but the rest of the movie was a typical well-done Peter Weir directed story.",7
"Words and ideas can change the world, but sometimes we are not ready to hear them","As good as movies get as far as I am concerned. Yes the acting/writing is a wee bit corny at times. But as a whole it functions masterfully, from Williams' performance, the colour and sound, lighting and cinematography, set dressing and location, story and pacing, all areas of this film meet and exceed any expectation of what makes a film truly great.

I once attempted to watch this many years ago while in high school, and was uninterested in watching a movie about other teenagers huddled around a cave reciting poetry. I stopped after half an hour only to revisit it many years later. This film is brilliant and has shown me a side of humanity I was not in touch with.",10
Better than most school films,"As with many High School English classes, we had to watch this over the past few days. Unlike most ""school"" movies, however, I quite enjoyed it. Robin Williams was great as usual, a pleasant change from his typical over-the-top comedy roles. He is one of my favourite actors, as he can play so many types of roles so perfectly. The supporting cast was great as well, each having their own moments to shine. The film had a very good message, to always stand up for what you believe in, and to seize the day, Carpe Diem! Part of the ending bothered me, to avoid spoilers I wont go into why, though the final scene certainly made up for it. Overall, I was pretty surprised with this movie. Who knew they'd actually make us watch something good in school!

This movies defines everything I have become and will become since the age of 14.,"One cold winter night, way back in 1994, shortly after her birthday, a fourteen year old girl and her mother were having girl's night. After spending an indeterminable amount of time in the local Blockbuster, the mother had selected Terms of Endearment. The daughter, wanting something lighter, and nursing a serious crush on Robert Sean Leonard, chose a Robin Williams movie called Dead Poets Society, assuming it was a comedy. That was the best mistake of my life. I went through a box and a half of kleenex from Neil's suicide on. Here is what this film taught me: 1) If all you think of from when you wake up in the morning to when you go to sleep at night is a profession, a talent, or an idea, that's what you are meant to do. 2) There is nothing wrong with being smart. 3) Each of us is given a brief time on this earth, and we must make the most of it. 4) You have to learn to think for yourself. 5) ""No matter what anyone tells you, words and ideas can change the world."" I'm not such a little girl anymore and I am preparing to leave in a year for college. This video will go with me. When ever I feel like giving up, like scraping it all to be normal, I watch this film. I only hope, as I prepare to become a teacher, I can inspire my students to make their lives extraordinary. Sincerely, Rebecca",10
Overrated self-indulgence,"The brats in this film cannot act, but they can scream, ever so stridently. Robin Williams puts a lot of energy into his performance, but the events are too pat and too predictable. The homilies are much too preachy. The attempts to tug at the heartstrings are much too obvious. In short, the whole thing is self-indulgent pablum.",4
"Subjectively thank you, My Captain!","I have watched several school movies in my life, and to be honest, I didn't like any of them. This is probably due to the fact that the authors focus on children's humor, relationships between students, first love, and more.

This film also has enough of that, but it is worth realizing how deep and acutely social the picture is. The main topics are the US education system of those times, parent-child relationships and hyper guardianship. Personally, all the mentioned topics are close to me and from time to time I experienced the same emotions as the characters.

The film gathered everything that I love in cinema - beautiful locations and shooting time, the theme of the film: rebellion, self-expression. However, sometimes it was difficult to visually distinguish the actors - they are very similar to each other. Maybe the directors wanted to make everyone the same, like the education system of that time? But the main role was perfectly performed by Robin Williams and it's hard to mix him with somebody else, bravo.

My thoughts are chaotic, because it is difficult to describe the emotions of watching. Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen.",9
Extraordinary,"Inspirational films run the risk of being boring and preachy, but ""Dead Poet's Society,"" an under-appreciated near-masterpiece, is neither. A great script, superb performances and excellent direction make ""Dead Poet's Society"" a truly amazing film.

The film takes place at Welton Academy, a prestigious boarding school for boys that prides itself on tradition. Enter John Keating (Robin Williams), a passionate poetry teacher who encourages his students to ""make their lives extraordinary."" With his unconventional teaching methods, Keating inspires his students to break out of the molds that their school is putting them into, and become individualsfor better or worse.

The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Robin Williams gives his best performance as Keating. Williams was born to play this role, plain and simple. He plays the role with so much passion that it is impossible not to become inspired ourselves. If every teacher were as good as John Keating, then I would have become a Nobel Prize winner by the time I reached college. Although this is not a comedy, the role does give Williams the chance to earn a few grins and chuckles (watch for the scene where he talks about Shakespeare). The young actors who play the students are no less compelling. Robert Sean Leonard is terrific as Neil Perry, a young man with his future already planned out for him by his domineering father. But Keating gives him the chance to break out and discover who he really is, but the threat of his father's anger always clouds over him. Leonard ably portrays the sense of a young man trapped in a life that he begins to realize is not what he wants. Leonard should have received at least some recognition for his performance. Ethan Hawke is also very good as the incredibly shy new student, Todd Anderson. Everyone knows a kid like Todd, who is so insecure that he has trouble speaking up in class. Hawke is so good that we can't help but feel for the guy. Josh Charles and Gale Hansen are quite funny as Knox, the guy who is lovelorn for a girl at the local public school, and Charlie, the rich troublemaker.

However, there is an actor that is often overlooked, and that's a shame. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as Neil's father. The talented character actor is actually rather frightening as the overbearing father. Yet Smith never lets the character become a ""villain,"" so to speak. He wants what's best for his son, and he gave everything to get Neil into Welton, but he can't understand that Neil may not want the life that is set out for him. Smith should have gotten an Oscar for his performance, though he was not nominated.

Peter Weir has established the perfect tone for the film. It's not the witty comedy that the trailers make it out to be (although there are some funny moments, including a hilarious scene involving a telephone), nor is it a manipulative tearjerker. This is a character exploration about a few young men who are breaking out of the norm and learning what life is really about, and who they really are. However, Weir makes one blunder, and it's a big one. The film's climax is superbly constructed (the sense of foreboding is quite potent and disturbing), but when the big moment comes, he makes a huge mistake by using slow-motion. It only lasts a few seconds, but it's so over-the-top that it shatters everything that the previous few minutes have built up. The film recovers as soon as the clip is over, however, primarily because our character identification is so strong.

This is a truly amazing film, and I cannot express that enough. I love this movie with all my heart.",9
An emotionally moving movie,"Just last night, for the first time in a while, my older brother and I watched the Oscar-winning movie Dead Poets Society, with our friend who came over last night. And I've got to say, it's a near-perfect, emotionally involving movie.

In 1959 Vermont, a teacher named Mr. John Keating (played by Robin Williams) is appointed the new teacher of the English department at Welton Academy, a prestigious all-boys preparatory school known for its immensely high standards and ancient traditions, of which he himself is a graduate. Mr. Keating uses unorthodox teaching methods to connect with his students, who face enormous pressures from both the school and their parents. Thanks to his help, several of his students, particularly the smart, outgoing Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), and the shy, timid Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), learn to break out of their shells, follow their dreams and aspirations, and most importantly, seize the day.

The acting is terrific from practically everybody. Robin Williams, America's king of comedy, who committed suicide 10 years ago this month, is fabulous as Mr. Keating. Just like in Jumanji and Mrs. Doubtfire, he gets to show off his serious acting chops, and he manages to do so without sacrificing his zany nature and mastery at funny voice impressions. Robert Sean Leonard is very energetic and fun as Neil, but also showcases his more miserable side. Ethan Hawke is fittingly nervous, reserved and soft-spoken as Todd. Norman Lloyd, who amazingly lived to be 106, is fittingly strict, formal and overbearing as Gale Nolan, the authoritarian headmaster at Welton, who detests Mr. Keating's approach.

The writing is fantastic, too. Dead Poets Society really manages to delve deep into its characters, particularly Neil and Todd. Neil, at first glance, seems like a cheerful, friendly guy. But in the scenes of him interacting with his domineering dad, Mr. Tom Perry (Kurtwood Smith), we see just how miserable he truly is. And though Todd starts out shy and timid, the movie takes the time to show him develop into a more confident person, thanks to both Mr. Keating and Neil. In addition, the movie ultimately feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, if you know what I mean, but in a more bittersweet way. It's just a pity Mr. Perry never learns his lesson about refusing to let Neil plan his own life. But that little detail is a bit of a nitpicky thing, and the movie just does everything else so well. The movie offers a great message about how conformity is easy, sometimes, you need to take risks. In addition to the plaintive tone, the movie also has good humor. Some of it is supplied by the students, especially the rebellious Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton (Gale Hansen), who slips a profane article into the school newspaper, and then plays a ""phone call from God"" prank. But of course, the best humor is supplied by Mr. Keating, especially the scene of him ordering his students to rip out the introduction of their poetry textbooks. ""It's not the Bible, you're not gonna go to Hell for this!"" HA!

Dead Poets Society also excels visually. It's gorgeously filmed, sometimes showcasing some lengthy, unbroken camera takes, and wide shots that showcase the beautiful area around Welton. It really allows the actors to tell the story when necessary. The lighting is absolutely perfect and natural, as well.

And lastly, the music. Maurice Jarre's score for this movie is very chilling and beautiful. It sounds especially uplifting in the ending. Added to which, it's centered around one gorgeous melody that assumes several different guises throughout, AND it sports a minimalist arrangement, rarely using a full orchestra. Sometimes, less is more! The movie also offers a mix of well-chosen 50's rock-and-roll songs.

Everything considered, Dead Poets Society is an excellent movie, that will tug at your heartstrings to no end, and easily one of Robin Williams's best movies. If you haven't seen this movie, well... carpe diem!!!

""Thank you, boys. Thank you.""",9
dead poet society will make you feel alive,"The movie is about a progressive English teacher who tries to enforce his student to break the norms and think outside the box and explore themselves. The 1989 movie is set in 1959 at an elite conservative boarding school in Vermont. Where a new student Todd played by Ethan hawks starts his junior year meets Neil who is is a smart student is also his roommate. They are introduced by their new poetry teacher. Robin Williams was not acting he was accepting, everything in this film seems to be real, a cut of the real world, a cruel however wonderful one at that. The themes this movie explores such as, never letting a moment slip by where you don't think for yourself, where you don't seize an opportunity, One of the scenes that I remembered the ""O Captain! My Captain!"" scene as showing the entire class rise and stand on their desks, united in honor of their teacher. It is a pg 13 movie that can be watched with family. The scene is emotional and shows the impact the teacher left them. Dead Poets Society was a hit at the box office and collected a lot of awards - including a Bafta award for best film and an Academy Award for best original screenplay.",10
Robin Williams does it again.,"Peter Weir directs Robin Williams in his best performance and his best movie. The story about a teacher who inspires students is one of the greatest films of its year, if not decade. The directing, writing and acting are all perfect. The music is excellent and the setting is perfect. The tears will flow by the end of this one.

RATING = 10 of 10",10
Extremely touching emotional drama,"This film has it all. Its touching, its sentimental, its funny, its emotional in all ways and it has a beautiful girl. In an American private school a group of students learn about letting themselves go but in the style of poetry which their new English teacher convinces them to read to learn about themselves. They become rebelious but not to a large extent due to the bullying by the teachers and parents who are completely conservative and do not want their children to do what they want in life.

So I dont give away a scene towards the end I wont say it but it is extremely touching. For sentimentals or intelectuals. 10 out of 10 and this is what films are all about. Not Star Wars...oh yeh..its better than Star Wars BY FAR.",9
Dead Poets Society- Film Review,"""Dead Poets Society"" – A dramatic film which makes you think about your own life.

""Seize the day!"" This statement is mentioned by one of the protagonists of the film, Mr. Keating, during his first English lesson at Welton Academy.

If you are looking for a film, which makes you thoughtful about your life and your own decisions, you should have a look at ""Dead Poets Society"". This film portrays a few students of Welton Academy, who begin thinking by themselves and living their own lives.

After the boys found out that Mr. Keating had taken part in a group named ""Dead Poets Society"" they become interested in poetry and decide to establish their own club. With the aid of this club and Mr. Keating's different attitude Neil and his friends develop their own wills and the wish of following their passions. By changing their ways of life they break the rules of the school and offend against the traditional four pillars of Welton as well as Neil's father's conceptions concerning Neil's future. Will everything be fine for Neil? To find out how the film ends you will have to view it yourself. Even though the film is a drama, it has some humorous parts and effects so that the atmosphere is not too depressing.

All in all, I can only recommend this film because it is classic and if I was asked to rate this film on a scale from zero to ten, I would give it 8 points. It is full of inspirations and shows changes in life.",8
touching and inspiring ...,"dead poets society is a movie ive been wanting to watch for a long time. finally made it and was pleasantly thrilled. the movie is wonderfully touching, with deft sensitive handling and an inspiring storyline.

the first half of the movie is wonderfully inspiring and elevating, though the latter half breaks down slightly and does get a little trite and cliched. though the magic of the movie is strong and effective. its beautifully scripted and the performances are very real and believable. robin williams as the teacher who impels his students to ""seize the day"" is excellent.

the movie is a must-watch for all dreamers and lovers of the arts - it is wonderfully heart-warming. and it has a lot of curiosity value as well, especially seeing ethan hawke from way back!!

all i can say is ""seize the day"". watch the movie

an inspiring 8!",8
Am I The Only One Who Hates This Movie?,"Often when I get into a discussion of favorite movies with people I meet, they are astounded by the fact that I hate this movie. That I loathe and despise this movie. ""How can you hate it?"" they ask. ""It's so inspirational!"" The only thing it inspired in me was a need to vomit.

I have enjoyed much of Robin Williams' work. I have greatly enjoyed Peter Weir's work - ""The Truman Show"" and ""Witness"" are among my favorite films. But ""Dead Poets Society"" just bothers me. I appreciate the theme, I appreciate the idea of a teacher who inspires his students. I just can't stand being hit over the head with it every few seconds. I can't stand the plastic characters.

But what really gets to me is this - there's a strange sense of defeatism about this movie. As much as it would purport to advocate individuality, it seems to advocate the belief that individuality can only lead to ruin. Take a long look at the fate of some of the major characters and think about how much the filmmakers really believe in the positive power of unconventional thinking.

In the end, the whole thing just seems forced to me, I guess. It's like the writer decided upon Point A and Point B for his characters, and simply figured out a way to railroad them all from A to B, instead of letting anything develop naturally.",5
Brilliant,Oh my God! Brilliant movie. I cried a lot. Awesome just.,10
"OH! CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN","I've watched the movie a few times now as Robin Williams playing Keating with a few laughs here and there is my favourite film. I had an English teacher who was very much like Keating's thinking, I always enjoyed his lessons. My brother went to a boarding school, it certainly wasn't anything like the school in the movie. I can't help thinking why the writer made Neil's father so against Neil's desire to act. Isn't it part of their growing up and adventure to do these things in school, like get a band together and put on plays, my brother certainly did both. Neil's parents were cold, his mother couldn't even put her arm around her son before going up to bed. The casting of the boys was just perfect, and the Casting Director needs congratulating for that. Hawke gave a stirling performance as did Robert Sean Leonard as the main two boys. Poor Neil he just didn't have the courage to tell his father what he wanted. Great movie, one I can watch over and over. Thankyou Robin may you RIP. I hope you knew just how much joy in your acting career you brought to us on the screen.",10
Inspiration at its very best,"I am still in high school and we just finished this movie this past week. Unbelievable is one word that describes this movie. The writing is great and the acting is equally astounding but the message lies no lower on the scale. To know what a materialistic and judgmental society we live in, this is such an important message to tell. I recommend this highly for any high school student. In one of the essays that I recently wrote I began it like this: ""We are hypocrites in our own nature. We tell our children to be themselves and not to give into peer pressure. We tell them to make a caricature of themselves and emphasize and celebrate what makes them different. All the while, we let society judge who we are and where we stand. We let it compare us to its definition of the ""perfect"" human being and define us. "" I wrote that before I saw the movie and while I was watching, I kept thinking of my last essay. This is the message that this movie is trying to emphasize.

""Two roads diverged in the wood and I-- I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.""

"Dreamy, relaxing, brilliant.","Imagine you are alone in your apartment. It's a lazy Sunday afternoon and you have just had a hearty meal.

The impending gloom of Monday has not yet set in and you want to spend some quality time with yourself before beginning to dread going to work the next day. If you like spending such afternoons indulging in a movie, this one is a great watch. There is a feel-good factor for the major part of the film with an ending that captivates you. You watch it once, chances are you are going to revisit some parts of it.

This film is absolutely worth your lazy Sunday and also, whenever you need a good cry.",8
"Captain, my Captain!","It is really a difficult task to handle the intersection of literature and cinema so successfully. The acting and script are flawless.

As a writer, I watched it with pleasure.

Watching this movie was like taking a small art break in the tiring life.

Even though 25 years have passed since the building, it still remains impressive.

The use of scenery, shooting quality and contrast adjustment (especially the cave scenes) are quite successful for its time.

In this short life, people should focus on the areas they love and definitely enjoy the moment. We must discover the talents we have been given and enjoy it. I take my hat off to such a production.

Respects.

Cape diem!",10
I don't get it.,"This is one of those films that just passes me by. I don't get it. I look at the effusive praise in a host of reviews, its high ratings everywhere, and the host of Oscar nominations, and I just don't understand the praise. The script is a confused mess without any real focus while taking this mushy-headed view of nonconformism that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. Watching this in the context of Peter Weir's body of work, it's weird how the unorthodox and inspiring teacher shares so many qualities with the insane madman that centered The Mosquito Coast, telling me that something was lost between when Weir started the film and where he ended it. But that so many people see it as some sort of inspiring piece of drama just eludes me completely.

Welton Academy is a preparatory school with a hundred years of history and strict rules about what is to be learned and how. The senior class is highlighted by a cadre of friends led by Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), joined by a new addition to the school, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke). Neil is the son of an overbearing father (Kurtwood Smith) who dictates every class and every extracurricular activity Neil takes. Todd is withdrawn and a bit out of place. Into their lives comes Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), a former graduate of Welton who is their new poetry teacher.

Keating is the center focus of the film from the outside, but he's actually a surprisingly small part of the film. He's very much a supporting player, and Robin Williams as Keating is probably my favorite part of the film. I get his appeal in general, and his dismissal of the ""Pritchard Scale"", an invented model for analyzing poetry loosely based on the work of a real academic, Laurence Perrine, that reduces the mysteries of art into a mathematical equation, is kind of infectious. Art is an exploration of humanity, not a trigonometry problem, and Keating exposing the wonderful world of art to boys who are living very structured lives is very rewarding.

However, the film simply stops creating any sort of comparison. It becomes all about the ""artful life"" without connection to anything else, with only the occasional sop to the more structured learnings of things like chemistry, mathematics, and physics. This is where the film becomes all tell not show regarding its central point, and it suffers greatly for it.

Another issue I have with the film is that its an ensemble piece about six boys at this school when there's an obvious focus in Neil. Instead, we get extended bits about Knox (Josh Charles) trying to woo a local girl that comes to no real conclusion and a couple of other minor subplots that amount to no more than a venial reading of the venial phrase Carpe Diem which seems to imply that the boys should just spend all of their time at this high-paying prep school smoking cigarettes in an old Indian cave and chasing girls. Now, I was a young man once, and I understand the great appeal of a teacher telling you that all that matters in life is poetry and girls and romance, but it's a short-sighted, venial look on life, not a deeply insightful or meaningful one, especially when it's not counterbalanced by a life of work. When you're working all the time to create something, taking a moment to seize the day means something. Seizing the day everyday leads to creating nothing.

And this is where my earlier point about the film being tell not show comes into play. We get one line late about how Neil has all A's in his classes, but we haven't seen him in one of those classes since about the ten minute mark in the film. We haven't seen him balancing his seizing the day with his hard work. It's all been seizing the day, and it creates this dramatic impression that he's a venial, unserious person who is abandoning everything to start acting. And you can see why wannabe artists would love this film. The actual dramatic focus is about how nothing matters but art, telling them to abandon everything in pursuit of your dreams of being an artist. It's unrealistic and a pathway for 99% of the people who take the advice to waste their earlier years in pursuit of a goal they cannot reach.

Now, I don't think that was what the script by Tom Schulman was trying to do: it was just too inept to actually accomplish what it wanted. He wanted the focus to be on this fictionalized version of a teacher he had in prep school that he loved, and it becomes this ode to him (the excised elements that Peter Weir got rid of about Keating's terminal illness makes that even more obvious), but it denies the central characters of the proper framing for their views. That is supposed to be handled by Neil's father's overbearing nature, but that is also undermined by the fact that Neil isn't the main character.

It's weird to sit here decades later about a film everyone loves and insist it needs a ground up rewrite, but I think it does. Make Neil the protagonist, but also make Todd the point of view character. Neil guides Todd through the student side of Welton, which includes a heavy emphasis on the more rigorous academic side, while Keating gets them to try and balance that out with his teaching on poetry. That balance is necessary for the point to work, maybe creating a counterpoint between the two boys as Neil gets more into Keating's side of things while Todd tries to keep things more firmly in the harder sciences, creating a contrast in how they approach life. You can keep the ending as it is, though I'll note that having a young man take such drastic actions because his daddy says he can't act anymore is a sign of deep mental illness. That's another reason I want more focus on Neil instead of the stuff about Knox trying to get laid.

I'll also note that the underlying point of nonconformism feels hollow since the manifestation of nonconformism here isn't really nonconformism, it's conformism to a new conformity. This is where the comparison between Keating and Allie Fox in The Mosquito Coast becomes the most apparent to me: they were both trying to create new utopias in established orders, and both led to disaster. The idea that Keating is a hero in Weir's mind while Fox was a monster doesn't hold water to me, and there's the moment late in the film where Keating seems to take personal, private blame for the tragedy that ends the film, like he held himself responsible for what had happened on some level, not that he viewed himself as a misunderstood hero who did nothing wrong, unlike the boys at the end.

Really, this movie is confused, and I really don't see how anyone thinks it holds up to serious scrutiny. Walking away with ""seize the day"" and nothing else feels simple-minded, but that's kind of what happens with the script as it currently sits. That it won a Best Screenplay Oscar is honestly an embarrassment.

Weir, though, brings his practiced professionalism to the production. His careful eye and strong relationship with actors gets great performances from everyone, so everyone is doing everything they can to make the most of this script. Weir was simply too talented to produce a disaster of a film, but he did make the most he could of a disaster of a script.",5
"O Captain, my Captain","O Captain, my Captain. Didn't expect this to be so sad and so good. Especially the last 30 minutes really got me.",9
Great 🍂,"'Dead Poets Society' has performances that stay with you long after the film is finished and Robin Williams' character, 'Mr John Keating' is one of the best-written characters in cinema yet. My favourite film :)",8
Wow!,"This movie is so fascinating. I just watched it for the very first time for a leadership assignment. I have never seen so much leadership in a movie. Just when I thought negative leadership was going to end the movie, it turned a different way to where nobody will ever forget the true meaning of sticking by each other through thick and thin. The way these students were treated was so absurd. I don't know how any student could learn. Robin Williams was exquisite in his teaching methods to the kids, and by treating them the way they should be treated in a unique way made the movie extraordinary. Also, because of the professor,the group of friends started to show their talent, and believed in themselves for the very first time.",10
Dead Poets Society,"""Dead Poets Society"" is my favorite movie of all times. It is about a teacher, a different one, who is much more than just a teacher, he's an educator. He teaches his students to avoid bad things from life and keep doing what they love. He teaches that this is the formula for a well-enjoyed life: you gotta seize the day - CARPE DIEM. And this message is the most important thing you can ever acquire. I think that when you understand and practice CARPE DIEM, you find the real meaning of life. And this is a wonderful movie to open your eyes. Besides, watching Robin William's performance is an acting class. I totally love this man. As an actress, poet and a teacher's daughter, I can say that this movie is very special to me. 10/10 for sure.",10
Carpe Diem,"Robin Williams' finest role is this wonderful movie that I have watched maybe a zillion times and will never grow tired of.

A simple story of a teacher who comes into the lives of young students at a boys' preparatory school and ""shakes things up"", this movie has been copied dozens of times since its release, and never quite as well. Robin Williams, as poetry teacher John Keating, tries to get the boys to think beyond algebra and chemistry and their acceptance to Harvard, and to start thinking for themselves. He urges them to ""seize the day"" and take control of their lives. And in changing the way his students think, he also had a profound effect on me... and I suspect, on the life of anyone else fortunate enough to see this film.

At once criticized for being a cliché and hailed as an instant classic, Dead Poets Society is both... and neither. It is simply a film that makes you think, question, hope and dare to dream. I think most of us either knew someone who affected us in a similar way as teenagers, or wish we did. Yes, the movie is full of exaggerated clichés - but whose life isn't at that age? And yes, the movie has also achieved a sort of new classic status. Hopefully, the superlatives won't kill the essence that is this film.

I've seen this compared to a lot of movies - mostly inferior ones made since, such as The Emperor's Club - but the best comparison I could come up with is to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Not for content, but for the underlying message... and consequently, for the movie's effect on people. Specifically, on me.

If you haven't seen this, you're sorely missing out.",10
The good and the bad fight to create a mixed bag,"I can look at Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society from two different lenses and come to two different conclusions based on them. The first lens sees a mawkish production, one looking to inflate its emotional climax by ways of theatrics and erect a film largely founded off of vague characters, common clichés, and quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets. I'd assign that film two stars. However, my opposite view sees the film as a production tackling themes of self-discovery and enrichment along with aspirations over obligations, utilizing quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets to its advantage. I'd assign that film four stars. The issue is I can't see one lens at a time, without the other covering it, as everything I've stated exists in this film to some degree. I'm compromising at three stars and going from there.

The story revolves around Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), high school seniors at the prestigious prep school Welton Academy, a school boasting the typical prep school philosophy of honor, excellence, and education. It is looking to be another year of mundane lameness for the boys until they meet their English literature teacher, Mr. John Keating (Robin Williams), who preaches the philosophy of ""carpe diem"" and informs them that they may refer to him as ""O captain! My captain!"" Immediately, he touches these students in a way they've never been touched before. The class that was once a bore to them has now become an outlet for expression and personal enrichment, along with providing them with personal benefits they had never seen. The seven teens decide to secretly revive the ""Dead Poets Society,"" a club that was erected to study and preserve the teachings and the beauty of poetry written by poets who have passed away. Keating was a member of the society when he attended Welton Academy and loved it, so naturally the boys want to have a similar experience.

When the boys create the society, the first thing I sort of cringed at was the way they acted. It was as if they felt they were making a difference to society in general rather than simply learning something in an institution that predicates itself off of learning in the first place. Then it hit me; that's exactly what they were doing. The beauty of Dead Poets Society is that these teenagers are actually learning and feeling like they're becoming better (or at least different) people because of it. Weir and writer Tom Schulman are specifically trying to detail the dramatic shift in thinking the boys are experiencing in school. It succeeds because we can see the difference in their actions and their way of looking at the world because of it. Consider when Todd runs outside after hearing tragic news to only stop and look at the snow falling and blanketing the grass below. ""It's beautiful,"" he says, before falling to his knees. Without Mr. Keating, he would've fallen to his knees.

However, I will say that by the end of the film, Keating is left too much of an enigma. He is all too clearly a metaphor of a captain, leading his shipmates (the teenagers) to a destination much different than what they intended. That destination is unclear, but the journey provides for a change of scenery for the boys. Robin Williams gives a great performance, but he's playing a character that is all too clearly supposed to be analyzed rather than resonated with.

All the teenagers do exceptional acting, especially Robert Sean Leonard as Neil, whose father (Kurtwood Smith) pressures him to no end to become a doctor or anything but what his passion wants, which is to be an actor. This is where I come back and explore another theme of the film, this time one that's rarely touched on. With all the coming-of-age films, it's a bit difficult to find one that shows parents dictating their children's live in a way that is memorable. Smith's performance as a father who appears so stubborn and dictative over his son's actions he comes off as ignorant to his son's cries for a different life is a scarcely-mentioned one, but the themes at hand here kind of overshadow it. The film handles the idea in a way that's difficult to explain, but easy, if not relatable, to view.

But in addition, the mention of the film's use of theatrics and mawkishness come to mind once more. There is a tragedy that takes place in the film (attentive viewers, like myself, will see it coming long before it happens). When it does occur, the way the film handles it feels more like a way to attract tears than actual reality. The slow-motion effect doesn't help the film's case either. Everything after that scene, including the obligatory scene of appreciating the teacher's accomplishments that's tacked on at the end of the film, feels rushed.

As one can infer, I'm hot and cold with this film. As an aspiring English major and a person who loves to read and appreciate poetry, I appreciate the fact that this film - if shown to adolescents - can show them that reading and analyzing can be enjoyable if taken with seriousness and a willingness to learn. However, there are times when the film strays off its unconventional themes and focus in favor of a more sentimental portrayal of impact and motivation on students.

There's a truly amazing film in here, but due to the film's attitude of trying to embellish its emotional impact and leave our faces tear-stained, it's kind of deluded.",8
Great stuff,"I had already watched this film in German language before I watched it in my English lessons in English, of course. Perhaps, I was too young when I watched the film for the first time. But now I've realised what a great story it is. It makes you think about yourself: ""Do I think on my own or do I just repeat what the ""HOI POLLOI"" tells me? All in all the movie is great but there's one problem I'd like to mention: Mr Keating makes his pupils do what he wants.

Praise for the film Dead Poets Society,"Dead Poets Society is the best movie I have ever seen. I never get bored to it, I have seen it already 8 times. My husband bought me it as DVD for Christmas present, that I would not break the VCR (by playing my old VHS-tape again and again).

Dead Poets Society is absolutely fantastic. Same time touching, sad, funny and fair story about boys, who live in an old, traditional boarding school. A story, how parents are trying to influence for children´s decisions about their career.

For my opinion, Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke played here the best roles of their career.",10
"""Seize the day... make your lives extraordinary!""","There have been many excellent movies dealing with the theme of teacher/ student interaction: 'To Sir With Love', 'Children of a Lesser God', 'Educating Rita', etc. In most cases the plot revolves around the teacher using special methods to reach students in difficult learning situations, or the teacher becomes a role model or inspiration for the student, or perhaps both, as is the case in 'Dead Poet's Society'.

And I suppose we can all think back to a special teacher who helped us at school, who put in that extra effort to forge a personal connection, and who really seemed to care. Maybe it was an English teacher who introduced us to a special poet or poem? Perhaps a film like this helps us remember these things about our own past, and that is part of the movie's appeal.

'Dead Poet's Society' is about a gifted teacher (played by the inimitable Robin Williams) and a special student, the connection they had, and the disastrous consequences which resulted. It's a uplifting film, a poignant film, a film that touches the heart.

'Dead Poet's Society' was directed by Australian-born Peter Weir who more recently directed 'The Truman Show' and 'Master and Commander'.",10
My captain oh captain,Robin steals the show as the rebel tacher to a strict college.Ethan Hawk is also good in onee of his first roles.Possibly Weirs best film so far.,8
The GOAT of high school dramas,"This is the greatest high school drama film of all time, bar none. The storylines for each character intersect in a streamlined and perfect manner, drawing you deep into the lives of these boys who lived a privileged life, financially, but who are crying out for a male role model who will guide and inspire them.

That man is Mr Keating. Williams is faultless in this role. Engaging, warm, intelligent with a sense of humanity that makes him come to life through your screen.

If only we all could have had Mr Keating as our English teachers, we would be better for it.",10
"""O Captain! My Captain!""","Robin Williams to me is beyond brilliant as the new English teacher John Keating at an all-male prep school Welton Academy. The year is 1959 and we follow a group of boys who are trying to figure out their course in life. Keating does an exceptional job in letting them direct it themselves. The students learn that Keating who once attended the school was part of a group called The Dead Poets Society which this group of boys re-establish under the cover of darkness. Of course nothing is quite that easy as there are major problems that arise during the telling of the story and I don't want to delve into them as I think as a viewer you should watch and experience them yourself. I will say though that it does get heartbreaking.

This is my favourite Robin Williams film and was one of the first that I really watched or at least really remember from back in my childhood. I think I may have been 10 the first time I saw it and was blown away right on my initial viewing. Directed by Peter Weir who has got a great line of films he directed, this just being one of them. The cast also includes Ethan Hawke as Todd Anderson and Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry who play roommates and sort of the two main characters within the group of boys, but really none of them take a backseat as they are all different and very well acted. Kurtwood Smith also plays Neil's father.",10
This is why movies exist,"If an alien came to earth and asked me to choose 1 movie to show him, this would be it. The best movie i've even seen without a shadow of a doubt. I could watch it time and time again.

It's both nostalgic and original, beautiful and tragic, cozy and a call to action not to live your life idly waiting. The movie feels like a beautiful poem. Like it was sitting on the writers chest waiting to be written. It features amazing performances from all, especially Robin Williams.

I never write reviews, but this movie is the one exception. I could 100 reviews and still find new reasons to watch this. Truly, this is ART.",10
Right,"Probably nobody will ever read this. I don't care. I want just to say this: i am a teacher and i know what it means. Great movie. (but IMDB wants a minimum of length, so this additional blurb is just to fill it in - consider my comment ended at ""movie"")",10
"I recommend that anyone who has not seen ""The Dead Poets Society"" should see it...","""Dead Poets Society"" is one of the most awesome movies I have ever seen! I recommend that anyone who has not seen it should see it; usually people of about 13 years and up, though I first saw it before I was that old. Very deep, emotional, and powerful movie with amazing, wonderful acting. There are boys in a boarding school, not all of whom really want to be there, and they all have emotions dreams that need to be released and lived out. Most of them have been taught and controlled to listen to their parents and follow strict rules of conformity all of their lives. A new English teacher comes to their school with a different way of teaching, trying to push the boys past conformity to feel their personal passion and live out their dreams, in order to express themselves and make a difference in life. There are many other people in the boys' lives (teachers, parents, etc.) that do not agree with what the teacher suggests and teaches to the boys. The two opinions of how the boys should be treated and taught fight a battle at the school and the results and effects of the battle will change the boys' lives forever.",10
"Fun on the surface ,&very meaningful & touching at its depth","Okay. So i came across this movie from a suggestion by my best friend, ishani. We always suggests movies to each other which are mostly fun.. So i thought this would be too.. Yeah see the poster i mean it looks fun ,a teacher changes or how he impacts the life of his students.. And by that impression I watched it... Thinking that it would be a light watch... But oh my, I don't think that I have ever cried or been so emotional, relatable, touched all at the same time while watching something on tv. I was literally crying my hearts out.. This movie does gives some valuable lesson.. Such as following ur passion always and fight for it.. And never ever submit to that fear fight with it... This movie has amazing poetries.. Especially blanket one.. It's every lines, poems have sooo much meaning... Although I would never forgive my friend for suggesting me this film.... But yeas I'll be thankful to her that she suggested such a touching, heart wrenching yet a good watch gem to me. I'm giving 9 because really I wanted something different at last 30 mins.. Realllyyyyyy... Don't wanna give spoilee alerts.. That's why can't say much about what I wanted towards the end... I loved the film but yeah it made me cry a lot.. But I suggest you should watch this... And Robert Sean Leonard is looking soo good ... If nothing else go watch for him... Nd yeah totallly loved todd's relationship with Neil... And yeah one last thing... I hateeee cameronnnnnnnn.... My suggestion : Go watch it CAPTAIN enought of diving into the reviews.",9
"Robin Williams is not the teacher we all need in our lives, but the teacher we all deserve","Dead Poets Society is an inspiring movie about creative thinking, individuality and the dangers of conformity. A very engaging and entertaining movie that's driven by its beautifully written characters and outstanding performances. It's a great inside look at the expensive preparatory boarding schools that exist in our country and how exclusive they are. Peter Weir is a wizard with visuals. That shot of all the different birds flocking when the school bell rings was great - there's some symbolism there. The way he films landscapes is magical. Great filming locations in this movie. Robin Williams is incredible in this movie, it is without a doubt one of his best roles. He represents not only the teacher we all want in our lives growing up, but the teacher we all need. The teacher everyone deserves. Someone that challenges us, breaks the rules and makes us think outside the box. Robin really was a special gem of a person. One of the most inspiring, influential, uplifting and funny people to ever walk this Earth. Truly a beautiful, witty and intelligent human being. I hope wherever he is, he's in a better place and happy.

The way everything is presented in this movie - the story, the way it flows, the dialogue, the chemistry between everyone, its messages - is perfection. Each character has their own distinct personality and characteristics from the other. They feel like real people, not written characters for a movie. This makes the movie feel alive. A beautifully shot movie with a keen attention to framing and atmosphere. Peter Weir has this beautiful way of shooting certain scenes that make them feel mystical, almost surreal. That shot of the boys running through night fog in their hooded cloaks was exactly that. The way he can capture that element of mysticism is something remarkable, it's something very rare and not seen in movies. Definitely sets him apart from other directors.

Robin teaches us to find our own individuality, identity and inner voice that makes us unique. He challenges us to question things (like the system and rules put in place), to find meaning where there might not be and most importantly to believe in ourselves and follow our passion. That whole sequence with the chanting monks in the background and Neil after his father tells him about military school was so haunting, ominous and hypnotic - incredibly done. You just knew something bad was going to happen. It's like the entire tone of the movie changes. A shocking and sobering reminder that parents can change their kids lives, sometimes not for the best - even if their intentions are good. It's sad really, because Neil knew what he loved, he knew what his passion was and what he wanted to do. This is a lesson to be learned by all parents.

A magnificent, inspiring, meaningful and impactful film. A must-watch.",9
Carpe Diem,"This is one of the greatest achievements in all of film. Robin Williams gives a performance that is his most memorable. He plays John Keating, an English teacher who inspires a group of young men in his poetry class to seize the day (carpe diem). He teaches the boys the beauty of poetry and the human soul.

The performances in this film are extraordinary. From Williams to Robert Sean Leonard to Ethan Hawke.This movie is as touching as it is wonderful. Movies like this are the reason we have cinema in the first place. It is a truly captivating and breath-taking picture. My compliments to Peter Weir (Who was totally deserving of the Academy Award for Best Director for this movie). An A++++ in my book.",10
Amazing in every way,"If you haven't watched it, go do it right now. If you have, you'll appreicate everything that went into this amazing movie.",9
The Best Ever,"This has to be one of my favorite movies ever. I think that it is the most classic example of an English Major movie. Robin Williams is phenomenal in this movie. He portrays the quintessential English teacher, quirky and eccentric. His character Mr. Keating, is one of those teachers who everyone loves, he's the teacher that you go to with anything, even if you don't' have him for a class. As an English Major I feel that this movie helps to show the beauty and the wonder that is English literature. The way that it is presented just seems to open the world of literature into mainstream. It invites people to go read Byron, Shelley, and Wordsworth. For me, it makes people want to read the classics, it is one of the things in this world that I think helps me to remember why, when I'm down having to read and dissect obscure literature, I chose to be an English major. It helps you to as Keating says ""think for your self"". Its a movie for everyone despite what I've said, because you take the message and it translates into anything, ""think for your self"". If I had to say anything about that I would say it was the moral of the story. Its helping to show people that they don't' have to be sheep, that they can think with out following the paved road. Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, for me this movie represents everything that I, as an English Major want to help show the world.",10
I cried... a lot.,"Objectively speaking, this movie isn't a 10, but I don't give a damn, this movie came to me at the perfect time in my life. I was sobbing through the entire third act. That feeling when you can't be who you are, because you don't want to disappoint who you love, is something I've been wrestling with my entire life. Becoming mentally ill because hiding the person you really are causes you to lose any sense of self, as if you are slowly disintegrating into an automated copy of who others think you are. Every beat of this film reached deep within me and pulled out all the anxiety and depression that festers at the bottom of my heart and told me to just breeeeeathe. We must not fall to the fate of Neil. This movie is truly beautiful and should be shown to every parent who thinks they are the writers of their children's destiny's. They still would not change but at least they'll have a different perspective.

Stay true to who you are, pursue your dreams, because life is too silly not to.",10
CARPE DIEM!!,"This movie is definitely in my top 10. It's a great story, and I have never seen surroundings so beautiful. This is Robin Williams absolute BEST performance ever. (Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke are great too.) It is a truly inspirational story and I never tire of seeing it. CARPE DIEM!!!",10
A very rare 10/10,"It's very rare that I give a movie a true 10/10. To give a movie a 10/10 is to imply that this movie moved me, that it changed my perspective on something, that it left me wondering and still thinking about it hours after watching it. When I first watched this movie, I had no clue what it was about. To be honest, it had no value to me. I read the description and I almost clicked away but something drew me to this movie. This movie never ceases to make me cry and leave me in a trance, and for that it gets a 10/10. The life lessons taught in this movie can be applied to any situation in life and continue to help me in the situations that arise in my life.",10
Was expecting better after the hyped reviews.,"I had heard this film was a classic and was expecting to get drawn in and mesmorised by an amazing story. Sadly an hour into the film I failed to see the hype. The issue, was it just appeared to be a flat boring story about some well behaved kids of privelege at a school where an unorthodox English teacher who enthusiastically opens their minds and views to how poetry is romantic and can ""change the world"" with all that Carpe DM BS... sorry but in the real world iv seen alot of people that are still holding onto that attitiude ""live for today don't think about tomorrow"" are alcoholic, skint, singletons... Anyway I digress... the kids believe every word of it without argument and the plot never really went anywhere, the kids were neither rebellious nor transformed in their attitudes by poetry. It was just boring. I just failed to see what was so amazing about it.",3
Its interesting and entertaining but never brilliant,"My Rating: *** out of ****.

Dead Poets Society is a good film but it was swept up by the academy. This is one of those times where the academy nominates something that is undeserving. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Robin Williams), and Best Original Screenplay. Out of those four, one of them may have been deserving.

The acting is solid throughout the film. Robin Williams gives a solid, convincing performance as John Keating. Yet, even know he is good here he did not deserve a nomination for Best Actor. For one thing, the performance is nothing amazing and he actually does not have a whole lot of screentime.

The best acting comes from the supporting players, who are the kids in the school. The best performance comes from Ethan Hawke. He gives an excellent portrayal as a shy, unassured teenager. The rest of the acting from the teenagers is all solid.

The Dead Poet Society is always interesting and entertaining but it never striked me as brilliant. Its a well written movie and it has its share of good moments but never really rises above. The movie does look great visually. The Cinematography is excellent. A Peter Weir movie (the director) always looks great.

However, the Dead Poets Sociey has flaws. Was it ever really necessary to have a subplot about them going into the Dead Poets Society? That subplot seemed really pointless. Also, there was a scene when one of the kids commits suicide. The music seemed somewhat pretentious during this moment. As did some of the shots. Why did the camera focus on the Dads slippers then? Whats the significance? Peter Weir has been accused of being pretentious at times and that whole moment seemed pretentious. Peter Weir has done better (Witness, Master and Commander).

Even with its flaws, I still liked Dead Poets Society. It was overrated by the academy but that does not make it a bad movie. Its a good film, its just not great.",8
"A Coming of Age Story as Good as ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""Scent of a Woman""","When this movie ended I was speechless. This is honestly one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. I was looking at some reviews of this movie and I saw that some people gave this movie horrible ratings. This movie is a true masterpiece. I really don't understand how some people can give this movie a 1/10.

I really don't understand why this movie is not on the top 250. It should at least be in the 100's. I think that this is probably Robin William's 2nd best performance behind ""Good Will Hunting."" I also think that all his students like Ethan Hawk did a great job too.

I honestly thought that this movie was A MASTERPIECE.",10
struggle for self-expression,"Great and atmospheric movie. The film reveals such a deep theme as freedom, the struggle for self-expression and the struggle against the system. Good performance from Robin Williams.",9
Tragedy was to show others the process of ruining the valuable things.,"Tragedy was to show others the process of ruining the valuable things. Neil was such a dynamic, and pure boy. When I saw his death, I felt something choked in my throat. He known what 'captain 'was talking about, his heart was full of passion to life, to art, to freedom. But how can a little bird against the stubborn system? I commented this movie was a tragedy not only Neil, but other's fates. I really loved the character Todd, who was much like most of us, not much colorful. When I heard of his poem about truth, I paused it, and read loudly it. I had to admit it was such a pottery one that I was shocked at that time. but who had inspired him might never appear in his life. What happened to other students? I remembered at the end of this movie, one of them said: they just wanted a victim, why let Keating ruin our life?' yes, after all these happinesses, life would always back to peaceful desperation. But I believe words and ideas would change the world, and those people would never be at gray area, because they're called heterogeneous",9
This Movie Changed My Life,"Okay, so that's a pretty big statement, but out of all the films I've seen in my life, this film is one that I can point to changing it. Some of it must have had to do when I saw it, teenager, and the typical teenager things I was going through.

For one, I started writing and reading poetry. If that isn't enough of a change I became a literature major in College. This film gave me courage to do crazy things, to step out of my shell and to actually ask girls out instead of thinking about them all the time. It affected my view of art, and that it's okay to be an artist and still be male.

I think it is an excellent coming of age film for boys, it goes through so many of the emotions rattling around inside during that time. The joy, uncertainty, pressure to fit in, attraction, betrayal, wanting love from a parent but never getting it and on and on.

I've seen this film enough times to see the flaws but I love every minute of it, flaws and all. There is so much subtly in the film that goes unnoticed.

When Keating tells the boys to rip the page out of a book, the Judas of the group uses a ruler to rip the page out but leaving a thin strip of the page in the book. A metaphor for when he betrays the others.

After reading some of the comments on this site, specifically the ones that pointed out why none of the beat poets were in the film, I came to the conclusion that it is interesting that the poetry studied in this film is full of structure. All the poems read were written in a strict poetical form, with the exception of Wadsworth. Structure is not devoid of beauty, just as chaos is not devoid of patterns. More often than not, it is structure that allows beauty to bloom. And although Keating was encouraging the boys to break out of the mold, to think for themselves, at one point when Neuwanda places a phone call to God in a school gathering, he cautions the boys to suck the marrow out of life, just don't choke on the bone.

I don't think the purpose of the film is that all structure is evil, but instead to find your passion, whatever it is. There can be beauty and passion in crunching numbers as much as painting starry nights.",10
awful,This movie is quite a boring film. We were made to watch it in English and it was a very boring film. The teacher also asked to write a movie review on this film but most of the class had no idea what the film was about. The teacher also asked us to spend our money to rent the film and watch it. i would rate it 0 but you don't have it!!!! all up this is an awful film. I would never watch this film again it was an outright disgrace i would not watch it if it was the last film on earth including Cinderella story i'm still having night mares about that one lol (laugh out loud) I'm being very serious about this (not the nightmares the movie) it is downright an absolute outrage.,1
The best coming of age film I've seen,The battle cry for youth looking to branch out against societal norms: carpe diem. It is the best coming of age film I've ever seen or know of. It invokes emotion and passion and motivates you to look at your own life to see if you've settled in areas you shouldn't. I've seen it over a dozen times now and it gets better each time I watch it as I catch more subtleties.,10
A lesson for life,"A film made more than 30 years ago about the time 70 years ago, and it is very applicable today.

People are put into molds, their lives, careers, professions are planned, and these young people do what is expected of them, not what they want. Free opinion is almost forbidden. It is enough to follow the young guys from the film who are all equally dressed, have the same things, room, objects, but as soon as you put them together, it is easy to see how each of them is completely different and is a special individual. And then when someone jumps out of someone's projection, expectation, or mold, then that person is looked at strangely, as if he is not normal. The whole education system is based on that, creating accurate and the same molds from people who are completely different, have different affinities, traits and desires. When a teacher appears who does not want to shape young minds in this way, but shows them the path they can take, which inspires them and shows them the possibilities, that same teacher looks strange and abnormal.

I have to admit that flaw of the film is that this is not the first time I have seen Robin Williams in similar roles, but the character is simply so nicely suited that it is impossible to imagine someone else who will show a great measure and combination of humor, seriousness, inspiration and sadness. The ending of the film was so emotional and perfectly rounded to me which is proof that the director succeeded in his plan because otherwise I am not a person who reacts to films like that.",8
A good movie,"Dead Poets Society is a drama movie which takes place in the late 1950s in the United-States. The story is set in a renowned boys-only preparatory school called Welton Academy, which is traditional, austerre and where the students are expected to be the best. A group of boys formed by Neil Perry, played by Robert Sean Leonard (who plays Dr Wilson in Dr House), Todd Anderson played by Ethan Hawke, Know Overstreet played by Josh Charles and others.

There are new English teacher, Mr keating (played by Robin Williams). He's an unusual teacher as his way to teach isn't the same as the other teachers. He talks to the student about an old secret organization : the Dead Poets Society, a poets group. The Boys decide to recreate this group and it will change their lives because they'll want to seize the day and they'll learn how to think for themselves, but it's maybe not a good thing for them and Mr keating.

I like this film because I love film because it's about school and relations between teachers, children and parents.

The movie had the Oscar for best screenplay.",8
O Captain! My Captain!,"Dead Poets Society hits you like a truck. It is so powerful that it will move you, inspire you, make you think. Exactly what Professor Keating (Robin Williams) did to his students. ""Boys, you must strive to find your own voice"" and of course ""Carpe Diem"" are two phrases that capture the essence of his philosophy. In other words, find your passion and go for it without wasting your time on what society or the rules consider right. From that moment on, his students' lives are changed forever. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) wants to become an actor, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) wants to overcome his insecurity and come to terms with himself, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) wants to capture the heart of a girl he met and Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), perhaps the most committed practitioner of Mr. Keating's teachings, wants to turn the world upside down and in the meantime have as much fun as possible. Another great thing about it is that it shows both sides of the coin, namely that even if you get in this state of mind, life works in mysterious ways and there are no guarantees of success or happiness, reality can crush you at any moment. All in all, it's hard to judge Dead Poets Society purely as a movie, it's more of a life experience.",8
Beautiful,"More meaningful and purposeful than any movie that I have ever seen, except for the Truman Show. Really shows the purpose of life and how you should live it. Also has some educational moments where you actually learn something. If you don't have an open mind and a really low attention span, you probably wont appreciate Dead Poets Society as much as others. It all really depends on your point of view. But I think that this is a work of art",10
Sweaty-Toothed Mad Man Society,"----- And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.

-----

""Dead Poets Society"" is one of the few films that have shaped my perception of the world. I'm so glad I watched this film.

How is this a 1989 movie? This film is still relevant today, and we crave academic validation and follow routines and discipline to the point where we have killed our creativity. It's rare to find artists and *poets*, like these in real life. We need to make this film mandatory to all!

To summarise, this movie is about a group.of elite students attending Welton Academy (or ""Hellton"") who conform to the strict norms of the school. However, when a new English teacher named Mr Keating comes along, their perception of the world slowly changes. Mr Keating teaches them to be their own unique character and think creatively. They do things they have never thought of before. The consequences shortly follow.

Every scene of the film is masterfully crafted. There are some specific shots that make for awesome desktop backgrounds. The music, suspense, and all other theatrical effects are WAY ahead of the movie's age. The characters are unique and feel real to me.

We need more movies like this that depict valuable morals. God bless Robin Williams, Neil, Todd, Charlie, Knox, and Peter Weir himself.",9
This is the best movie ever made. Period.,"That is a very strong claim to make, and as you all can see (for those of you who HAVE seen this great film), I am so enamored of it that when DPS came out 9 1/2 years ago, I casually picked up the nickname ""Neuanda"" (chosen by one Charlie Dalton, a character in the film), and haven't let go of it since.

It is extremely important to tell all of you who have not seen this movie that your experience with DPS will not remotely mirror what I went through when I first encountered it. Some of you will love it, some of you will loathe it, while others, still, will have mixed reactions.

And that is the beauty of it (and the beauty of moviedom, in general).

I was 15 years old and emotionally poised to receive a movie of this calliber. I was young enough for it to become a part of my still malleable soul, and old enough to understand the gravity of its message . I can only hope that something similar will happen for all of you who have yet to see it. The movie's message is a simple one, but profound and enlightening, just the same. Please take the 2+ hours to experience it, and relate it to your life the best way you know how. That is all I can ask.

Carpe Diem and Enjoy.",10
!!!CARPE DIEM INDEED!!!,"I will make this very short since I always find it difficult to put into words(in this case writing) when I encounter a wonderful experience. ""Dead Poets Society"" is the biggest inspiration I ever saw put on film and I couldn't have seen it at a better time because I am exactly at this point in my life. I am becoming the master of my destiny and this movie made me believe in my path even more. Robin William's performance of a lifetime and the rest of the cast is just as superb!!! Thank you boys.",10
"""Captain, my captain!""","If you say that is Robin Williams' best film ever, and without doubt one of his best performances, you will not hear me object to it! Cause I would agree. Williams does a magnificent job. Because usually he covers his characters with too much funny faces and joking around, so that it gets a bit tiring after a while. But in ""Dead Poets Society"", he masterfully combines his genious comedy-talent with his more serious side of acting and it's a winning combination.

Peter Weir's directing is awesome, and the combination of a great story, excellent acting from all actors involved, solid camerawork and both humour and drama, makes this one of my all time highs!",9
Ode to Freedom : The Timeless Brilliance of Dead Poets Society,"In the tapestry of cinematic masterpieces, Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society emerges as a lyrical sonnet, a celebration of literary and poetic flavors that enchants the soul. A film so magnificent, it illuminates the path to emancipation from societal dogmas, embodying the fervent desire of adolescents to break free - free from familial constraints, free from societal conformity, free to be authentically themselves.

This cinematic gem is not merely a film; it is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of art, a profound reflection on life, freedom, and the essence of true education. At its heart, Dead Poets Society is an ode to liberation, an exploration of the delicate balance between conformity and individualism, presented through the lens of a group of young students guided by the charismatic litterature teacher, Professor John Keating.

Professor Keating, portrayed with unparalleled brilliance by Robin Williams, is the linchpin of the film's narrative, a maestro leading his students on a journey of self-discovery and free thought. His passion for literature becomes a catalyst for emancipation, a rebellion against the conventional norms upheld by the school's dean.

The film navigates the tumultuous waters of conflicting educational philosophies, where the dean, an advocate of rigid scholastic protocols, stands in stark contrast to Professor Keating's visionary approach. The professor yearns to nurture free-thinking minds, urging his students to think for themselves, to make the study of literature a tangible and transformative experience.

'Can one think for oneself when young?' is a central question posed by the film. It extends beyond the confines of the school, echoing the universal journey everyone must undertake between the sheltered environment of academia and the harsh realities of the outside world. The film subtly critiques the submission to various constraints - be they ideological, familial, social, or political - reflecting a poignant fatalism that questions whether true freedom is the ability to do anything or the desire to embrace what one can.

For me, Dead Poets Society etches an indelible mark as one of the finest cinematic creations, transcending the screen to become a contemplation on freedom, conformity, and the eternal quest for self-identity. It probes into the depths of our souls, prompting us to ponder - who are we, and who do we aspire to become? How can one navigate the labyrinth of societal constraints while finding happiness and fulfillment in personal choices?

This film encapsulates a timeless and impassioned debate, weaving a touching and thought-provoking narrative. Dead Poets Society stands as a cinematic marvel, a beacon of humanism, drama, and beauty that proudly claims its place in my top five. It's a treasure I'll revisit time and again, for it encapsulates all I hold dear today: poetry, theater, literature - a symphony that resonates with the chords of liberation.",10
Discovering Yourself and Living Life to the Fullest: A Review of 'Dead Poets Society',"""Dead Poets Society"" is a drama film from 1989 and was directed by Peter Weir. Its main characters are played by Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles. The movie tells the story of an unusual English teacher, John Keating, who teaches his students to think for themselves. The movie is visually pleasing, and the actors deliver great portrayals of their characters. The characters in ""Dead Poets Society"" have great character development and are all different to each other, each character has their own unique personalities and problems to overcome. Robin Williams plays his character, John Keating, very good. He teaches, like mentioned above, his students to think for themselves and to do what fulfils them. Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles perform great as Keating's students. All of them have issues they have to deal with and have a lot of pressure on them. The supporting cast is also great, adding depth and more emotion to the film. What makes ""Dead Poets Society"" truly great is its message of embracing individuality and taking risks to fulfil yourself. Its catchphrase ""carpe diem"" translates roughly to ""seize the day"". It means you should take risks to fulfil yourself, before it is too late. The film shows how important education is, because it is able to change a person completely, and the importance of seizing them when given opportunities. You can tell that that is a good message, since most people, us included, think that ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary."", said by John Keating is the best quote from the movie. If you love great storytelling, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a must-see film that will leave a lasting impact.",9
Seize the moment,"Ah, a superb classic. I watched ""Dead Poets Society"" because, well, I was bored. And I wanted to watch a movie I'd assume would put me asleep, well, actually I stayed up to watch it. The story is very excellent. And with fantastic actors such as Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, and Ethan Hawke. I would recommend this wonderful drama to anyone.

"not a ""must-see""","I know a lot of people consider this movie to be a classic but I found it to be just sappy for the sake of sap and a complete lack of any humor. For that I don't see this as a ""must-watch"" so much as a ""must-know"" because the film did produce so many catch-phrases that we hear in pop-culture such as ""oh captain my captain.""",3
Oh captain! my captain !,"Dead Poets Society is a drama film set in Vermont, New England in the late 1950s in which we follow the story of Todd Anderson a painfully socially anxious boy who's transferred to the well-reputed Welton Academy, his new social butterfly roommate, Neil Perry, and their friend group.

As the school year begins they are introduced to their new unorthodox English teacher, Mr. Keating, who's played by the famous actor Robin Williams. The teacher along with his surprising methods will change the boy's perception of life through poetry and push them into seizing the day.

This drama is my absolute favorite film. I love the message behind it, live for the day because you could die any day without ever having the guts to accomplish anything. I don't think I could bring myself to choose a favorite character because they're all so endearing. I loved watching Todd's self-development throughout the movie and the rest of the group's change of way of life. Sadly it isn't a happy movie but the sad part of it was necessary for the characters' development and makes it the wonderful, life-changing film Dead Poets Society is.",10

Tugs on you heart strings.,"This film was something that tugs on your heart strings. The way it shows you to be yourself and to do what you love and enjoy it to your full potential. It also shows that having a good teacher who genuinely believes in you and what you want to do is so important in giving you the courage and resilience to do what you love.

Robin Williams has done it again, showing what a great actor he is and he is such a father figure to so many young kids. His character 'Mr Keating' inspires his students to seize the day through his love of poetry. He shows that its perfectly normal to be passionate about your hobbies, telling his students to grab what makes them tick and never to let go of it.",9
What a movie.,"I won't say much, but this movie profoundly affected me. The boys, the teacher, the things they went through. It gave me the deepest thoughts to ever transpire in the wake of a film. I still think about it in a somber mood today. From how Robin Williams simply excelled in the role to how I can only see each boy in that one role. Their scenes, quotes, some things still just resonate with me. Even if you don't enjoy one of the actors, or this type of a film. I would consider it a must watch, just to make the most of your life, and see something that it really, truly, a masterpiece. 10/10 for everything.",10
Touching but not enough,"When I watched this movie for the first time, I was looking for a job as a teacher. I was very moved and wanted to be a teacher like Mr. Keating. Complying with the students' nature will make people feel empathy and respect; in contrast, we are usually limited by many rules against our natural desire. But now, after being a teacher for many years and studying postgraduate education courses, I think the film is more about opposing education theories confrontation with less positive communication. Mr. Keating's idea about ""learn to think for yourself"" is a valuable limited resource in many classrooms. But it became the only learning content, deviating from society and reality, it is also problematic. In the film, Mr. Keating asked the students to tear up all the poems related to realism, which is avoiding further discussion between reality and human nature. If these conflicts of ideas cannot be considered in the curriculum to develop more profound and complex understandings, then these conflicts will be reflected in the real lives of students and teachers. It caused the tragedy in this movie.",8
This movie is an inspiration,"Dead Poet's Society has everything necessary for an exceptional movie. First, an Oscar winning screen play. Second, an exceptional cast Robin Williams is a great actor and was paired with Ethan Hawke this combination is incredible. Lastly, a director meant to blow your socks off Peter Wier knew exactly where to go with this any one who hasn't seen this movie must see it (NOW). This movie inspires everyone to get up and do, ""to suck all the marrow out of life."" This is truly a movie for all it has a little language and a few sexual innuendos, but that is nothing to be taken into consideration.",10
almost as good as sky high(2005),"This is my favorite autumn movie. It's heart wrenching, and the ending makes me mad. Red forman was really pissing me off. Also, neil and todd were definitely in love and you cant change my mind.",10
Fantastic,"One of the most striking movies I have ever seen. The characters are written beautifully and you grow to love them quite early on. Before watching this film I read the book, which was also beautiful and which I definitly recommend.

I think everyone, especially parents and teachers, should watch this movie. It can teach you new things and show you another persons' perspective. I cried my eyes out and wish I can re-experience watching/reading this story for the first time again.

Side note: beautifull cinematography and aesthetics throughout this movie. I wish we had more films like this. Simply beautiful!",10
Remarkable Storyline,"Where do i even begin? I, myself being an English major student hadn't watched this film earlier. I was advised by my friends to watch it and i'm so glad i did. I think this is one of those movies which you can call your ""comfort"" films. The storyline, the acting, the characters, the poetry, the direction, the quotes, literally there's nothing in this film which you can dislike. This is one of the most beautiful films i've seen and i would recommend everyone to watch it. You will not be disappointed. If you love the drama genre and you love poetry, i think you're gonna fall in love with the quotes, setting, characters and the storyline. Overall, this movie is just too good, you have to watch it in order to believe it. This film teaches us so much if we pay attention and the advice they give: ""seize the moment"" ; just remarkable. From beginning to the end, this move is a true masterpiece.",10
Outstanding,"Dead Poets Society has got to be one of the best written films I have ever seen. The way the writers are able to control your emotion is insane. You truly go on an emotional ride in this film as a viewer, and will feel ever single emotion there is. The acting is outstanding and it's really rare to see a cast that clearly understands their role in the film and portrays it not only realistically but rememberable. This is one of the few films that I will remember for the rest of my life just because of how good it is. Definitely my favorite Robin Williams movie and I recommend this for everyone.

Overall, 10/10.",10
"Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.","Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American drama film directed by Peter Weir and starring Robin Williams. The film is set at the conservative and aristocratic Welton Academy in Vermont in 1959. The story follows an English teacher, John Keating, who inspires his students through his unconventional teaching methods and love of poetry.

The film explores themes of individuality, freedom, and the power of the arts to inspire and transform. Through Keating's teachings, the students at Welton Academy learn to think for themselves, to challenge the status quo, and to seize the day. As Keating says in the film, ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.""

One of the most memorable scenes in the film is when Keating leads his students to the school's amphitheater, where they read poetry and express their emotions freely. This scene showcases the transformative power of the arts and the importance of self-expression.

Overall, Dead Poets Society is a powerful and moving film that challenges viewers to think for themselves and to embrace their individuality. It is a celebration of the human spirit and the boundless potential of the young.",9
"One of the best film of all time, for ""free thinkers""","I watched this film the first time when I was 10 or something, but was falling in love with the film when I was 17. The same age of Knox Overstreet, Todd Anderson, and other guys in the movie.

""Dead Poets Society"" talks about the lives of the students in the ""Welton Academy"", an elite prep-school preparing the students to ivy league school. These students were brought up in a strict and mainstream families.

All unexpectedly, the students are exposed to Mr. Keating, an English teacher whose will change their lives through ""free-will"" thinking.

One of the best film of all time!",10
The best,"O Captain ! My Captain !

Great moving movie,"I felt like it talks about me. I love it, I have to admit I think its one of my favorite movies all time. Thank you Robin Williams Rest In Peace. And to Ethan Hawke you are so talented.",10
"An interesting take on the arts in school life, along with the downsides of extreme art addiction","The film works as a whole as great entertainment and also as an engrossing message to the society. I am not sure what to make of the heavily dramatic climax, does the director want us to love arts? Or is he warning about the burden that comes with loving anything too much? My guess is the later, as he is an artist himself (Cinematic art). The film stays buoyant from the starting to the end, typical of a high school setting and all characters feel natural. The teacher who inspires everyone seems to breathe life into all his fans (students) and increasingly dwells in our hearts as a hero who lets us ""live"" in this ever-competitive, heartless, unequal world.

Overall, I walked away from the film as a changed man with lifelong repercussions. The movie is labeled as legendary by many others as well and I recommend this wholeheartedly if you like offbeat films about education. The dialogues are lovely and all the interactions between characters are interesting. The film has enough twists and turns to keep us engaged throughout its duration..",8
Seize the Day!,"Having a strong role model is instrumental in the development in our lives. Whether it's an athletic coach, parent or an English teacher, we are all touched uniquely by those around us.

We are all arguably trying to attain happiness in our lives. This can range from searching for love and exploring the world to volunteering at the local animal shelter. Regardless of ""what"" we strive to do, it is important to realize we are genuinely interested in fulfilling this void.

Poetry is more than just another form of expression. Language is arguably the strongest tool we as humans have, and is a special talent that can be used to accomplish extraordinary feats. Throughout the education system, students (and even teachers) often begin to forget the purpose and importance of the content being learned.

Enter Mr. Keating.

He is no simple man nor is he carrying a stringent course outline. He allows his students freedom; the chance to realize and fulfil their potential, whatever that means. He encourages his students to explore, understand and seriously think about society and the world we live in. He is an example of what every child deserves...what they need. It is sad to see people live like drones despite the immense opportunities the work has to offer. It is crucial that we learn to seize the day and actually make the most of our lives!

Living your life according to your will and yours alone is a testament that should be widely advocated. Not one where people are necessarily individualistic, no, but one where everyones learns to enjoy every moment of their lives. Why spend your life doing something you don't enjoy? Be passionate and live, since the worst death is one while you're still alive.",8
Be against something....,"...no matter what.

That is the message of DPS.

This is a pretty dumb, extremely overrated, obnoxiously preachy and for all purposes as far away from reality as the two extremes of the universe.

It took me a while to watch DPS. Well, all these I 've missed nothing.

Lived up to the expectations!,"Honestly, I watched this movie because Dr. House mentioned about it on the S8E21 of House M.D. When I checked the trivia on IMDB, realised that Wilson was the protagonist in the movie and that got me interested and how could I say no to Robin Williams... Lovely it was. Must watch.",10
Depressing But Inspiring,"""What a terrific movie, terrific perfomance, and terrific story, all in here is just extraordinary, i really enjoyed this so much, i don't even know what i'm gonna write anymore it just already perfect and i don't see anything wrong, overall Dead Poets Society is depressing but very inspiring, i highly recommended""",10
Seize your day and watch this movie,"From Director Peter Weir (The Truman Show) and screenwriter Tom Schulman (Honey, I shrunk the kids) introducing this classical school melodrama set in the world of ""America's best preparatory school"" Wilton Academy where the students bearing names like ""Pitts"" and ""Meeks"" (you couldn't find whiter names?) are introduced to their new English professor John Keating (Robin Williams) who comes bearing his informal and contemporary teaching methods making him appeal to his new students immediately.

The movie-set in 1959-follows the theme of challenging the conservative, conventional style of life and encouraging a new free thinking style presented by the character of prof. Keating, who, to be honest, didn't take much time getting into the heads of a group of white nerdy boys who do study groups in their first day of school, really lads? Anywho, professor Keating, who keeps constantly quoting Whitman, Herrick, and Tennyson, introduces the boys into the ""cute"" world of poetry in a very dynamic and playful acting much as the actor himself, losing himself into his theatrical persona where he reads Shakespeare sonnets impersonating Marlon Brando from the godfather (uhmm somebody needs to tell Robin that the godfather deputed 19 years after the time of the movie) but regardless of his outstanding performance as the quick witted, fast paced professor, I'm afraid that Robin Willam's character does not fit as a protagonist of this film rather than the tool that helped the plot move, the character wasn't anything more than a very well crafted plot device in this movie.

The main conflict we see in this movie is between a young Robert Sean Leonard playing the role of Neil, a smart student who dreams of becoming an actor, and his hardheaded strict father who denies him his wishes in fear of it disturbing his education (probably the only white boys in the US who cannot defy their parents) a conflict which ends up in a most tragic way.

The dead poets society is a secret society founded by an intellectual equivalent of a 98 Pound weakling teenage version of professor John Keating himself, and reincarnated by his young students who get immediately attracted to the idea of poetry under the influence of their charismatic teacher, the reincarnated form though, seems to be completely purposeless (well asides from meeting in a cave in the night, wooing chicks with other poets lines and dancing to Vanche Lindsay's ""The Congo"" (one of the poems that critics debate it's racist content which is ironic in an all white cast movie).

The movie's cast including Robin Willams, Robert S. Leonard, and Ethan Hawke did a great job portraying their roles and quite frankly hiding the many flaws in a movie that has not one, not two but three scenes with birds flying off in one sequence (maybe Peter Weir is trying to compensate for the lack of ""birds"" in the all boys school?) but all in all the movie is quite enjoyable, entertaining and indeed, worthwhile.",8

A Williams Wonderpiece!,"Its a terrific story that is completely stolen by Robin Williams's heart.

If you removed him from this movie, people would struggle to remember it, Williams is everything to the Dead Poets Society.

Outstanding.",8
Spectacular,"Dead Poets' Society is by far one of the best movies I have ever witnessed in my 17 years of life. No movie has more impacted my life on a daily basis as this one has. The reflection on what society expects of us that is consistent throughout the entire movie is intriguing and presented in a likable way. This extravagant movie is filled with quotes you will hold onto for a lifetime, helping you to cope with the distressing situations that life will bring. Each character's plot line speaks about another type of existence, proving that we all have our own individual lives. Each person's plot is an extension of the theme that life is more than a career. Each person's hope and dreams are hindered by society and its demands on the individual. An outlet for this stress is the Dead Poets' Society, which is a collective group of boys in the private school. They write poetry and songs, sharing with one another. They express the demands on them as teenagers in this world: ""Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling, Gotta do more, gotta be more. Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming, Gotta be more, gotta do more."" This along with several other lines is what intrigues me most about this movie. The poetry is written so artfully to fit its message, and succeeds wonderfully in this outstanding movie.",10
Carpe diem,"Seize your day : that's all about I am thinking. Being a procrastinator this movie really hit me to do things and stop to just worrying about them. But but don't do all things recklessly is also stated in there.

From now on all I want is to make sure that I live enough that makes me happy. I am going to Stop Putting people before/above me in my priorities, There I am suppose to be first one What a motivational movie it is!!! Without any high proficiency sports theme.

One more thing special about this movie was it wasn't focused on specific character as past or future of that character it was all started in present and it lived through the present.

One more note:- don't try to add ladies to a beautiful dead poets society. Mandatory!? Yes it is.

Till then Carpe diem.",10
Dead poet society Movie's review by Khitab Wazir,"Dead poet society movie depicts the gruesome face of society and the traditional poor system of academic institutions. These two things play a major role in ruining the life of a creative student. Their creative ability cannot thrive in the presence of these two factors. It has shown in the movie how lots of fathers decide the fate of his son and then how dreadful consequences it might bring. They do not let their sons to decide their own choice. And most importantly how art is considered an absurdity been also shown. The character named ""Neil Perry"" wants to become an actor but his father does not like it, because art has no value for him. Despite of the reluctance he comes onto the stage and performs the play, in the meantime his father comes and eliminates his son from this school. Neil Perry then commits suicide and embraces death. To be more precise dead poet society movie interprets some bad factors of a society by which a creative boy or girl's life gets ruined. These factors are 1poor school system 2authoritative/Dictator type guardian 3devaluation of art 4restrictions to think openly.",8
This film made me an English Major :-),"Dead Poet's Society is a delightfully well-crafted coming-of-age film from director Peter Weir who has garnered his most recent notoriety for ""Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World."" In this film, Weir takes us to a small New England prep-school at the tail end of the 1950's and shows us one school term in the life of a teacher and the group of students that he inspires. This film is an emotional roller-coaster and features subtly brilliant performances from the entire cast. This may very well have been Robin Williams' finest hour. We are given a slew of passionate performances and a truly inspired script which unquestionably deserved the Oscar that year. This film is also a great lesson in independence and free thought. Throughout the course of the film, we see the group of students who re-form the Dead Poet's Society grow from boys into men. They find their own voices and learn to 'seize the day.' A truly powerful and inspiring film and quite possibly on of the best films yet made.",10
Good,It was a different movie. We can call it a classic right now. They also had good messages. Mr. Williams did a great job. I recommend this movie.,8
"Boy, feeling Joy.","What's the real meaning here?

That poets and artists should get an equal stage of importance as all other ""useful"" professions like teachers and scientists? In this age of mass media and art funding they already do!

That people should stand up for their individuality and question authority? In this age of free speech and public debates they mostly do, even if organised violence still counts against unrestricted freedom.

What people have forgotten though, is the permission to enjoy life. This is different to having fun on an ego-trip, or following the common path of profit. Enjoyment requires sincere participation in life and society and reflection upon it's direction. What is the point of life if you can't enjoy it?

The protagonist as a young man drew his legitimate conclusion and unfortunately did not realize his alternatives of overcoming authority. The movie is as much a rare anti-establishment statement as Good Will Hunting (also starring Robin Williams) and as such unmissable, even after all this running time.",10
"poetry, romance, and love are the reasons why we are born human","The opening was exciting, the midfield looked exhausted, and in the end, there was a final victory. In the end, it turned out to be a victory, deeply ingrained in my heart. The murderer is undoubtedly the ""captain"" who taught his students the pursuit of happiness, but did not teach them resistance. He taught them to become an idealistic poet, but did not teach them the cruelty of reality. The opening chapter full of ideals ends with a tragic event, where ideals eventually return to reality and are constantly suppressed by reality. Finance, engineering, architecture, and computation are certainly important, they are the conditions for our survival; but poetry, romance, and love are the reasons why we are born human.",9
One of the best Robin Williams has done.,"This is a terrific film with a great storyline about passion, identity, truth and literature, set in the context of an exclusive all boys preparatory school. All English teachers should have the enthusiasm of John Keating, played brilliantly in this film by Robin Williams, who has come upon the tradition bound school with a creative vengeance. What results can be described as educational alchemy- the magic of inspired teaching that allows learning to take place.

Some viewers may find the story line too simplistic and sentimental, but no one should ignore or deny the film's messages, which include the importance of art in enriching life and letting the true self shine forth.",10
"A smorgasbord of bad acting, obnoxious characters and cliched storylines","The doe-eyed camera hog Robin Williams accepts a job at a prestigious school knowing full well that the school's values are in direct contrast to his whimsical hippy-dippy teaching style. In his desperation to be popular, Williams leads his barely distinguishable pupils down a path of dead-end careers, sexual harrassment (Dad, how did you and Mum meet? Well son, she was unconscious and I just started groping her) and academic self-destruction yet still bows out a hero. Possibly one of the most overrated films of the 20th century.",4

Cinematic Beauty at Its Finest - One of The Greatest Movie of All Time,"I watched this movie when i was 12 and it brings even the slightlest change into my life. I'm not a type of person who would often willingly rewatched a movie for a second time. But there are a few movies that the more you watch it, the deeper you can appreciate each and every single detail. The more you can see and understand, it's like looking back to your favourite moment of life in the past, over and over. The feeling of comfort.

That's all what Dead Poets Society at least could offer. This will be the number one movie i would say if someone ask me what my favourite movie is.

This movie talks about art, poems, friendship, youth, freedom, and all the great lesson of life. All in one, it's all what my soul longing for.

I have never seen such a movie with a very beautiful cinematography and also a touching, impactful story to tell. Each character has their own special place in my heart (definately except you know who!). Each character has a huge difference from one to another, and i think it's represent the diversity of many souls in the earth. They are all different, yet are all precious. I personally find myself has a big similarity to Todd Anderson. Knowing people had to been through the same thing as you are bring a sense of comfort and the safe feeling of being home. This movie feels like home to me.

Let's talk about what i gained and what opened my eyes from watching this movie.

Tears. Tears. Tears.

An absolute emotional roller coaster. Neil didn't deserves his life to be controlled.

This movie is all what you could ask for--joy, comedy, romance, drama, sorrow-- i cant even find the right words to describe this movie. Very hard. And this is all what i could say, there's still so much thing in my head yet i coudn't make the words out.

I love this so much. You missed so much thing in your life if you havent at least watched this movie once. I'd never getting bored of this, i would not be complained at all if this is the only thing i could watch for the rest of my life.",10
PERFECTION; RIP ROBIN WILLIAMS,"A timeless classic that every high school English teacher will make you watch. Revisiting this film really makes me miss Robin Williams.

Taught me how to engage with your friends love your teachers and share the things you love .

One of the greatest movies of all time Overall, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a must-see film that deserves all the praise it has received over the years. It's a poignant and powerful story about the importance of following your passions, challenging the status quo, and living life to the fullest. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",10
"Brain jolting, exhilarating","Certain movies and incidents leave a very deep impression upon you. This is a movie that jolts every corner of your brain and raises questions on the very meaning of the word success which has been stretched too far by the orthodox and out-fashioned minds. It's movie that I wish had a very happy ending instead of an emotional one.

I have always been inspired by the works of Robin Williams and his approach towards mankind. This is his masterpiece, in fact, I would go along with historic performance. Its a movie that in spite of its era continue to relate to individuals at various levels (credits and profound thanks to the writers).

Dead poet's society is more alive than any movie I have ever seen or heard. It forces individuals to come out of their cocoons to be the beautiful wings of glorious imagination.

P.S.- I would rate this movie 11/10 but I gave it 9/10 because I had hoped for a very happy ending. Nevertheless a must watch.",9
A refreshing if obvious drama.,Dead Poets Society shows the efforts of a filmmaker who has his own loving style in making movies.,9
best movie ever,There isn't alot to say about this movie other than it is perfect. It is as beautiful to watch as The last Emperor or Room with a view but is even more emotionally powerful than both. Not one of the actors is ever anything less than genuine and believable. The story is compelling and thoroughly easy to get lost in. This is what all movies should aspire to.,10
Stunning.,"Truly one of the best films ever made, not to mention the incredible acting. No words to describe but stunning.",10
I like everything about this movie; except the movie itself,"I like poetry. I like Robin Williams. I like Peter Weir. I like Maurice Jarre. So, I had high hopes for this movie and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. It seems in almost every dramatic or semi-dramatic film that Robin Williams stars in, he plays a victim. I kept waiting for him to be picked on and it sure came. John Seating is a new teacher at a very strict school called Welton. His styles and teaching methods are not what the students are used to and his love for poetry inspires them to reopen an old school club called the Dead Poets Society. At this point, the movie falls downhill. I think the problem is the characters. The director tries to make us love and connect with them, oh how hard he tries. But, oh how much I didn't care by the end. We needed to know more about John Seating's personal life and not just his job. Besides a few good themes scattered throughout, there is not a lot to gain by watching this film.",5
one of the few movies to make me cry,"As a rule, I don't normally cry at movies, but this one is a genuine tearjerker.

This is one of my favorite movies, because there isn't a whole lot about this movie to dislike. The acting is excellent (especially Robin Williams, who can do dramatic acting almost as well as he can comedic), the story rings true and the dialogue is memorable. A really good film.",8
The reason why I love movies!!,"It is one of these movies that touches you and makes you reconsider your life. It is astonishing how well these young actors perform, while Robin Williams draws a remarkable path in acting.

If you haven't seen it yet, DO IT. ""Dead poets society"" could be considered as a must-seen film 🎥🎥",10
O Captain! My captain!,"Sure, sometimes the movie is on the edge of kitsch but who would have thought beforehand that a movie with a teacher trying to inspire his students for poetry would turn out to be such a success. What's more, the movie has also turned the Horace aphorism ""carpe diem"" into a term that has found its way into modern language and is widely understood. One has to concede, however, that the movie does not deliver its original meaning, which is more about enjoying life as it is than shaping it to one's favour.

Usually I am not such a big fan of Robin Williams as I am not so fond of clowneries but in this movie, he, as Mr. Keating, was playing the unobtrusive part of his lifetime. This opinion apparently was shared by some colleagues from the show business who in their shows, on the occasion of Mr. Williams's death, climbed up a table just as Mr. Keating did in Dead Poets Society to demonstrate how the change of perspective can alter preconceptions.

Besides, the movie can also be seen as a didactic play on what effects a liberal or a strict education can have on teenagers. It will, hopefully open the eyes of all parents who are convinced to know best what is good for their kids without ever asking the kids what they want. The message of possible disaster, however, does not come across completely convincing since I could not quite understand why Neil felt so trapped since otherwise he was a self-confident young fellow.

Eventually, the movie also perfectly demonstrates how recklessly established systems react on outsiders who question this system and try to change it. In case of any occurrence that puts this system and its stakeholders at risk of lower outside acceptance, a scapegoat is quickly found and removed. By doing so the stakeholders count on the cowardice and fears of its dependents and unfortunately this calculation frequently pays off. So does it in the movie. The final scene with the students climbing up on their desks to demonstrate their solidarity with the scapegoat Mr. Keating makes a good ending but does not change the overall situation. It does demonstrate, however, that Mr. Keating's endeavors to encourage the students to become self-confident, non-conformist members of society have fallen on solid ground, especially with Neil's shy roommate Todd, the first one to stand up for the captain, Mr. Keating. Hence, not all is hopeless and changes for the better are possible 

All these interesting aspects along with the many and so diverse coming-of age character studies of the classmates make it a movie definitely worthwhile seeing. Especially it is quite different from most other films.",8
"Very sad, but good!","This movie was very sad, although I won't say why because then my review won't get posted because of spoilers. However, despite its sadness it's a very good movie that I really enjoyed. I would watch it again, except that I cried so hard at the end that my eyeballs fell on the floor and I had to stick them back in. Obviously to make anyone that sad it had to be very good, which it is. The characters are likeable and the acting is outstanding. One of the best movies I have ever seen, and everyone should see it eventually. Regardless of Roger Ebert and his negative review, the fm is still a classic. If you're wondering whether it's worth it, the answer is: go see it and find out for yourself.",10
'O captain my captain.',"I've probably seen this film at least 25 times (probably 20 times in 1989 alone) and the final farewell to Robin Williams at the end still leaves me a blubbering mess. It still stands the test of time and remains my favorite Robin Williams performance. Kudos to Peter Weir. Yes I know it owes a lot to 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and gets a tad too melodramatic towards the end, but the acting, script,direction and terrific score make this one of the finest movies of the 1980's. As an added bonus - if it encourages young people to seek out such magnificent writers and poets such as Shakespeare, Whitman, Keats and Shelley - well, that alone makes the film worthy of high praise indeed.",9
Dead boring,"I tried to get through this, but I just couldn't. It was really really boring and juvenile. Majority of the film is a bunch of nerdy teens acting immature and being very loud. It reminded me of the goonies. Robin Williams is barely in it, majority of screen time is hogged by the dull Ethan Hawke. Thumbs way down.",2
To the heart and beyond.,"This is the first review that I'm going to write, and perhaps the only one, for the simple fact that this movie really got to me.

Excellent Robert Leonard's role as Nail, he makes a real beauty connection between him and we as spectator, and showing the spark of light of a positive person. There is nothing to say about the performance of Robin Williams, he was brilliant, always reaching the soul with his dramatic performances. Also very well the rest of the cast, keeping in line and letting us to go deep in the film.

The story tells how a group of young people can be influenced to be much better people than they were, in the spiritual aspect, of course. But it also tells us how passion can be obscured under the strict discipline and how it achieves the destruction of the meaning of life who exists in each of us.

I should say that this should be a obligatory film for both teachers, youth and parents.

I was really touched by this film. If you didn't see Dead Poets Society, do not do like me and wait twenty years for see it. Go and watch it now.

Carpe Diem. 10 of 10.",10
Not as good as I was told it would be,"The movie was good, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

I thought the teacher would be really inspiring and creative, but Robin Williams just didn't measure up. This is the first movie I've ever with him in it as the protagonist where I didn't think he did a great job with the acting.

I still suggest you see it if you haven't because of all the literary connections and the good message it portrays. Education should be interactive and teachers should engage their students in worthwhile exciting discussions, and these values are definitely shown through Robin Williams' actions throughout the movie.",5
The Greatest Movie of all time,"I think that Dead Poets Society of all time. The acting, cinematography, writing, etc, it's all so amazing. Some of the best performances of the movie are Robin Williams role as John Keating and Ethan Hawke's role as Todd Anderson. Director Peter Weir fabulously directs this film, and it's his best movie in my opinion. The movie also has a very powerful message, (which I will not go into in this review because it will take too long). The movie also has many great quotes like, ""Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinarily."" I also really love the setting of the movie, like the landscape and how it goes throughout different seasons over the length of the film. The ending of the film is also extraordinary, in my opinion it's the greatest film ending. The movie is also well paced and doesn't feel like it drags at any point. All in all this is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it, you need to watch it.",10
Close to Excellent,"For me, the two best dramas of the quarter century were made in 1989, the first being Tornatore's 'Cinema Paradiso', the other, this film. Today it's illegal to have a spirit, so do we pursue an artistic life in an age when Art is 200 years dead ? Absolve the painter for the seaman, the musican for the technician ? The theme to this film will span the next 600 years, in that tragic respect it makes this a classic.

I'd like to comment to Robert Lorenz, from Dresden, and anyone who; if posting destroys a film's credibility without giving one to compare it with, in doing so destroy their own. Also to dbdumonteil, who recommended Weir's embarrassing estrofest 'Picnic at Hanging Rock.' No doubt to be a favorite in Ivy/prep circles, this film does under-tone a bit too much for me, and in the music (the 80's being the shift to subtle scores). The Literature profs can tear this up all they like: picking Frost over Byron, not getting to the meat of Shakespeare, yet petty needling whilst crap like 'The Breakfast Club,' and 'The Deerhunter' was made and hailed. Cliché's abounding it's message supporting spiritual individualism sets it above the rest. Casting could have been a little better.

Maybe they meant 'Carpe spiritus' (seize the spirit) instead of 'carpe diem' which better synopsizes this film; a solid script telling us it is better to have attempted to live the life of the artist than to experience it as crude nonevent; always with dire consequence.

Enough cannot be said about Robert Sean Leonard in a radiant performance; also Robin William's best role ever, and Ethan Hawke's last best role ever. This is better watched once, instead of repeatedly dimishing it's glory.",8
"Dead Poets Society is a simply transformative film, the audience follows the journeys of the boys as they seek to free themselves from the bonds that have been imposed on them","Dead Poets Society is an American drama, shot in 1989, directed by Peter Weir. Its plot explores the conflict between romanticism and realism, and the latter is present from the film's opening scene to its tragic climax and its apotheotic ending. From the perspective of Todd, a shy young man terrified by the fear of possible failure in his future, and his roommate Neil, a genius and ambitious boy, who is beaten up by his controlling father, the film portrays the English educational structure and the relationship unilateral agreement between the school and its students.

The story begins when the traditional Welton Academy, which specializes in preparing its students to enter Harvard and become future lawyers and doctors, hires a former student and now professor of literature John Keating (Robin Williams). Contrary to Welton's inflexible pedagogy, Professor Keating begins his class by deconstructing the idea that his class has about what poetry is and teaches them the power of ""Carpe Diem"", a Latin expression that means ""seize the day"", making a harsh criticism to the society in which they were inserted, which no longer knew the pleasures of living the freedom to make their own choices. In the midst of eccentric activities, Professor Keating makes his students search for knowledge, instead of simply absorbing it.

Motivated by this new perspective on reality and learning, the students find an old school yearbook and there they discover that the literature teacher was part of a type of fraternity called the ""Dead Poets Society"", in which the members gathered in a cave. (perhaps here an allegory of Plato's cave) to recite poetry and reflect on it. Inspired by this new discovery, Keating's students decide to create their own version of the Dead Poets Society, and begin to gather to recite poetry, play characters and touch on their romantic or realistic nature.

Tom Schulman's screenplay is one of the most beautiful and tragic ever made. The story that follows a group of teenagers at Welton Academy, an extremely rigid boarding school, is quite capable of transforming the life of any viewer. Schulman, like all good classic screenwriters, establishes the group with only one huge conflict: the castration of the passions of the most restless and uncertain period of anyone's life: adolescence.

As practically all the characters are already used to the atmosphere that puts tradition above all else in the Academy, we are introduced to this atmosphere of silent classes, as if death itself was hovering in the air. Everything is cold, quiet and orderly, as if it were a true classic dystopia like 1984 or Metropolis. However, all the depressive monotony is broken with the human warmth of the new English teacher, John Keating, who introduces students to a new way of seeing the world, of learning about life and allowing their passions to blossom so that they have an identity. His didactics are completely opposite to the conventional one at the Academy - his hiring is one of the film's biggest mysteries, but it doesn't remove you from the experience in any way.

What Schulmer captures perfectly is the spirit of these boys, giving them some unique traits but focusing most of the drama on Neil (in a conflict-filled portrayal by Robert Sean Leonard) and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke). The use of these two characters is quite curious and cruel, since the final fate of both manages to betray the expectations of those who watch, making the biggest twist of the film quite unpredictable.

Despite an initial confusion about who the protagonist is, Neil ends up being consolidated as the main character. In a remarkable delay to get the film in gear, Schulmer lends naturalness to a Manichean game of curtailing Neil's desires in the face of paternal oppression that forces him to follow an already predestined future. However, with Neil discovering his true calling, this relationship becomes complicated and cruel.

Cruelty that Welton Academy also shares as the narrative progresses. We have a truly simple story, centered in reality on a very pertinent problem that insists on repeating itself in several generations. Schulmer is clever enough to come up with an unforced metaphor about the ""Dead Poets Society"", the club that boys form to be a little freer in the face of the prison that boarding school represents. Using poetry and the growing passion for art as a pure new form of expression embraces the didactics of Carpe Diem and of adopting different points of view to see the problems and challenges imposed by life, never adopting cowardice.

By challenging their parents and teachers to finally discover who they really are, they are doing much more than just rebelling against a rigid authoritarian system, they are finding their voices and desires. After all, everyone needs to have a voice of their own and swim against the tide instead of just floating and letting themselves be carried away by the waves. And in that, this film is timeless, as it teaches through poems by famous authors to find who we are inside ourselves, even before we have the courage to show ourselves to the world. And who better to teach us that than a teacher?

This is where the film is especially brilliant. We follow the journeys of the boys as they seek to free themselves from the bonds that have been imposed on them and how each of them copes with it. Tom Schulman's screenplay (""A Very Bad Election"") talks about the dangers of extreme parental repression and lack of empathy with loved ones, using a clever metaphor to address the dangers of conformity to illustrate how censoring art is censoring. The individual. This ends up producing disgruntled and stressed citizens with life, resigning themselves to the roles of zombies who only repeat what is said to them, locking society into a sameness that prevents progress. The text can tend to be a little too melodramatic at times, but nothing that really gets in the way of the narrative.

The title may put off some viewers who are averse to poetry, as it has an unfair reputation for being difficult and boring. However, ""Dead Poets Society"" does not defend poetry per se, but art in any form, and how it can reach anyone in a personal and profound way, how it can instigate and change a person, how a person can find comfort. , love, passion... in short, feelings. The film is a great representation that art, even blockbuster pop art, can help those who consume it understand themselves as human.

Peter Weir's direction is simple and magnificent. With the right positioning of the lens, the director masterfully paves the script's narrative. The scene where the shy Todd has to recite a poem at the front of the room is a masterpiece. With Keating helping him overcome his fears, the camera constantly pans around the duo, both isolating the two from the rest of the gang (since the moment was between them), and also illustrating the whirlwind of emotions within the boy. At the height of the moment, the camera stops and moves away, allowing both the characters and the viewer to admire Todd's victory and achievement. Exciting!

This lightness of emotions and simple transitions with images of freedom through the richness of the staging in deep contrast with the fixed frames and immobility of the camera when preparing the scenes at the Academy, makes Weir's direction quite interesting, despite passing away from his most inspired.

Only at the climactic apex of the work do we have a deep succession of intelligent images that express a melancholy sadness already foreshadowing the worst to come. We have projections with shadows, frames that enlarge parts of the body - like the huge hand that closes a door, in addition to a delicate work of John Seale's fantastic lighting. Through the feverish power of montage and score, Weir manages to create a memorable scene. But none surpasses the conclusion of the work that, despite being bittersweet, shows how Keating managed to transform the lives of some students who no longer resign in the face of a completely silly orderly oppression, believing that the manufacture of genius takes place through punishment, standardization and the preservation of outdated traditions.

Dead Poets Society is a simply transformative film. Although slow and apparently uninteresting at first, the experience evolves completely as the characters gain more relevance, in addition to the punctual but fascinating presence of Robin Williams who transforms every scene with his full energy using the power of his body expression and smiles to the fullest. Gentle for boys.

Like all good classics, it becomes quite intimate for dealing with a conflict that seems so silly in today's eyes, but so pertinent in showing all the consequences of fierce psychological coercion over young people's dreams. The atonement of guilt will never take away the responsibility of those who only oppress and never listen. Basically, a summary of the truculent human relationships over the centuries.",8
A marvelously inspiring story with one of Robin Williams' best performances,"DEAD POETS SOCIETY is an incredibly moving film by Peter Weir about life at a boys prep school. It stars Robin Williams as John Keating, an English teacher, with Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke as two of the core group of students. I went into this film knowing a little about the plot from various clips on the internet, e.g., the famous ""Oh captain, my captain"" line. I was also aware about the fate of a character, although I didn't know which one until watching it. I was generally very impressed with the film, and Robin Williams' performance in particular. The story is one that had the potential to be very clichéd and overly sentimental, but the themes discussed within were approached earnestly and backed up with some great performances. Robin Williams is especially great as the English teacher, whose unique worldview (at least in the stodgy prep school environment) and unconventional teaching methods inspire the boys to make the most of their lives and dare to break the mold. The film follows several of these boys who are inspired to ""seize the day"" in various ways. Robert Sean Leonard's character pursues his dream of acting and another character, Knox Overstreet, pursues a girl that he loves despite the threat of her boyfriend finding out. Together, the boys bring back a poetry reading group originally started by Keating, called the ""Dead Poets Society"" (hence, the title of the film). This wasn't actually the point of the film, but more of a jumping-off point. The wonder of the film is to see how the boys develop and change for the better under Keating's influence. I can't say enough how much I loved the message. That being said, there are a couple of areas worth talking about which aren't as great. One of them is that given the large cast of characters, more time could have been spent developing them, although what's there was adequate. There is also a climactic scene which, while still handled tastefully, felt a little emotionally manipulative. Overall, this has to be the best of Robin Williams' dramatic roles that I've seen so far. It's an engaging, thought-provoking and moving film about making the most of your life, even if the setting is a bit overused. Highly recommended.",8
thoughts,"The best performance Williams ever gave. One-could it work as a musical? Two-possible sequel-might have to juggle dates a bit-some years later,boys at college,Keating organising against Vietnam war-including draft resistance!",9
a feel-good film,"'Dead Poet's Society' is a film about a professor who teaches poetry to a classroom full of boys so that poetry can be respected and appreciated. It's a film that has gained a pretty good following over the years. I've known this film to change the lives of some people a little bit and to appreciate life more. In short, it is one of the feel-good films with a good moral.

A comparable film (in some ways) is 'Mona Lisa Smile' which features a professor at an all-girl's school who teaches art history. Then, there was that film who had a professor of English teach military students how to appreciate literature and Hamlet. Each of these films shows how the students grow and begin to appreciate learning.

Well done. I wouldn't call this the greatest film, but it's a job well done.",5
Carpe diem,"This film is very touching. It can play on play on the strings of the soul. Firstly, the plot tells us the story of growing up in elite school for boys. It shows that education system can kill all desire for learning. Also it shows that parents can injure kid's psyhic. Secondly, the cast is great, especially Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke.",10
Great Film,"I've seen many movies that I'd consider to be ""favorites"" of mine. This one stands out above all. It is very inspirational and moving. If you have not seen it yet, do yourself a favor and see it. You will be a better person for it. At 15 years old I appreciate this movie as brilliant and a classic, I'm sure the appreciation will only grow with age.",10
start thinking,"The film was published before the book. The book based on the screenplay. It was published in 1959. It plays in Vermont. The film ""Dead Poets Society"" is about a school called ""Walton Academy"" where boys are taught very strictly and with a lot of discipline. But there is one teacher who teaches the students to be free thinkers. He does not care about consequences. A large roll is John Keating who is played by Robin William. He is a young English teacher who is different from the other teachers. He tries to inspire the students. His motto is ""Seize the day"". Also important is he Headmaster Mr. Noland. He is a contraire to Mr. Keating because he is very strict and traditional. The most important student is Neil Perry. He is a boy who is like a leader of his friends. His father puts a lot of pressure on him. Neil suffers under this. In my point of view the way of Mr. Keating's teaching is a good way because he is open minded and motivating. He wants that the students live their life extra ordinary. They should have an own point of view. That is what I like. The film is well accomplished, because it shows how a very strict school is. Moreover you can imagine better what you really want in life. You are stimulated to think more about your life. Maybe you change something in your life because you remember that it is not imagination. I can recommend watching the film. It isn't a predictive film because it has a surprising turn. This film never gets boring. To sum up one can say that the film has a great motto ""Seize the day"" and this is relevant for everyone's life. Everybody can be someone great. You only have to try it. So watch the film and learn from it.",10
We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.,"A very well made High School Drama that keeps you interested right from the start. Robin Williams' acting as an unorthodox professor in the traditional high school is really upto the mark. The dialogues are very well written. It emphasizes on the importance of art in human life and how showcases how damaging it could be to belittle someone's passion. Preety good direction and a tight screenplay. Tradition, Respect, Discipline and Excellence - these four, as described by Mr. Nolan, are the pillars of his high school and Mr. Keating is a person who teaches to be free, think free and seize the day. He's the English teacher and doesn't follow the traditional methods of teaching. He teaches the students to own their thought irrespective of what the rest of the world world says about it. The climax of the film proves that he succeeded in his teaching.

I really loved the lines - ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.""",9
carpe diem indeed,"it's a pure, absolute picker-upper of a movie. It should be handed out by therapists to their depressed and undriven patients. The script is rich, and as poetic as the existing poetry in the film. While Peter Weir's direction is restrained, it all makes the settings more natural and believable. And he draws out some remarkable performances.

It's a pristine story of a new english teacher who gradually opens his students eyes on how to live. By their own rules, instincts and impulses. And when the brilliant lectures come out of robin williams, it's like he's talking straight to the viewer. Asking us to ask ourselves if we are doing enough to make our lives truly extraordinary. And it all works so damn well. Coming off best are williams, ethan hawke, and robert sean leanard, who's fate is enough to move the most stone of heart. The best film of that year. Almost became second best in the picker upper stakes, when american beauty was released in 1999, the only other film, to me anyways, that i think can inspire and move in equal measure.",10
"Not bad, but...","I like the pretentious premise. The ""fight against the educational system that suppress individuality, passion and expression and critical thinking in search of pragmatism and efficiency valuing life in dollars/'success' and nothing more"". I like that. Alos, Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke are excellent in the roles of confused young adults/teens. All their scenes are great. But...

Insert: Robin Williams. And I just can't. I don't believe a thing about his character. I don't believe he's smart, nor that he's inspiring. His weird methods only made me think he was dumb and weird, more than different and better. Maybe with a better dramatic actor in his place, I would consider good this exact same movie.

Besides that, neither the score, nor the dialogue (except for a couple), nor the emotional conclusion of the story were specially great to counter the downside of having Robin Williams.",5
"""Make your Life Extraordinary"" by watching this film!","Robin Williams just takes over the screen in one of the best movies I have ever seen. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are also awesome and are just pheonominal. The writers wrote a great script with wonderful lines that stay with you, like ""seize the day, make your lives extrodinary"" and ""There is a time for daring and a time for caution, a wise man knows which is called for."" And, if you have seen the movie, the last and final scene is the most remarkable ending to a story I have ever seen.",10
Seize the day...My friends,"I generally don't write reviews,but this movie has forced me to do so.This is one of the best movies that you will ever see in your lifetime.Be it acting,directing,story,etc everything is just perfect.It encourages you to do something only if you are passionate about it.There are just too many souls on this planet who are following the heard.We need people who are passionate,original and creative to make this world a better place for all and ""Dead Poet's Society"" delivers just that message in a tremendous way.It is a masterpiece that will blow like a fresh breeze right onto your face.",10
QUESTION EVERYTHING... including yourself!,"It's absolutely disgusting what humans will do in the name of conformity. See WWII if you disagree and see the Milgram experiments at Yale University for a look into exactly how badly humans are at questioning authority. To blame a teacher who is involved in your son's life for less than a school semester for his suicide shows a level of denial of reality that astounds me to a point beyond belief. You had this child for at least 16 years or so and over the course of a few months a teacher made him suicidal!? The lack of personal responsibility shown by these parents is despicable. So many people are like that. I'll never forget when I had the epiphany that my parents, and every single other adult, regardless of age, were just other humans... Question everything and everyone. Be careful of certainty and conformity. Conformity is not all bad and it is perhaps required, but it should never go unquestioned.",10
Robbed in broad daylight,"This movie is truly great! I have been a fan of Robin Williams for years, but always for his humor(which he is, by the way, a MASTER of). Dead Poets Society proved that he was a true actor, playing a very dramatic role in light of many humorous lines in the movie. This movie is the greatest performance of his life! The only thing that disappointed me was that Robin Williams did not win Best Actor at the Oscars. He was robbed blindly, and deserved it for this far more than for his role in Good Will Hunting!",9
A masterpiece...,"Dead Poets Society....what a movie. It's superb in every part. Acting, directing, script, etc. This is such a powerful story about life, and living it to it's fullest. I know a lot of people who have seen it and say that it's to sad for their taste. Now don't get me wrong, it is a very emotional movie and very sad at parts. But the overall message is so powerful and moving. From beginning to end, it held my attention. And one of the best things is: not only do you feel like you're watching a movie. You actually feel like you're one of the students going to the school and a member of the Dead Poets Society. That's how real the characters are. Everyone of the boys is like someone you know, or knew. They're real people, struggling with real situations. That's why I love it.",10
Timeless and life-changing and terribly important,"Let me put it this way: if you haven't seen Dead Poets Society already, then you owe it to yourself to do so. Yesyes, despite everyone saying that 'you simply must see it!'. Think about it like this: if you do, then the worst that can happen it that you don't like it. If you don't, then you risk missing out on one of the best films ever created and (more importantly) not getting that life-changing revelation. Which revelation? Watch and find out...

A review (for those who want to know what they're getting):

Directed by Peter Weir, who manages to take every tool a filmmaker has to his disposal, and uses them to create a monumental masterpiece.

The acting defies the term 'superb'. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are truly great, although I would name many more if I could. They so convince you of what they're feeling, that you truly care about them.

The cinematography is endlessly excellent, I could write a long essay on it. This is one of those films where you can sense the contribution made by everybody behind the camera. The lighting, sound recording, set design, everything! is magnificent.

The story is flawless. It tells a brilliant story brilliantly, and then also defines what it means for a story to inspire people. You cannot walk away from the film without being a different person than the one earlier.

Again: watch it if you haven't. Those who have already don't need to be told to watch it again. They simply will. And you will too....",9
down-to-earth performance,"An inspiring, endearing & emotionally stimulating tale that's further strengthened by a surprisingly down-to-earth performance from Robin Williams in addition to the spot-on chemistry between its young cast, Dead Poets Society is an affectionately crafted, skilfully directed & smartly scripted work that only asks its viewers to dream more urgently & live more fervently.

The story takes place at an all-male prep school during 1959 and follows a group of students who are encouraged to unleash their creative side by their new English teacher, a former alumni of the school. As he inspires them to look at poetry & life with a different perspective, his students restart the unsanctioned titular club and begin challenging the status quo.

Directed by Peter Weir, the film introduces all the relevant characters in the opening scene but it takes a while to get acquainted with most of them and separate one from another. However, once their English class begins, and their new teacher's unorthodox methods unlock their true potential, it turns into an enjoyable, entertaining & thoroughly nostalgic drama that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.

The atmosphere, for the most part, is infused with a positive, creative & optimistic vibe and all the moments featuring Robin Williams is a delight to watch. The fine dynamic between its young actors makes them convincing as a group, and their individual contribution is no slouch either. Camera is operated in a smooth, static fashion. Editing is controlled, unfolding the narrative at a steady pace, while its score adds flavours of its own into the final print.

Coming to the performances, Dead Poets Society features a wonderful cast in Robin Williams, Josh Charles, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Norman Lloyd & others, with Williams impressing the most. It's a finely measured & highly grounded effort from Williams who as John Keating delivers a performance that arguably his best. And he is brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast who all play their part with flair, both individually and as a group.

On an overall scale, Dead Poets Society is a wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama that tries to illustrate the importance of finding one's true passion in life and embracing it wholeheartedly. It packs plenty of laughs over the course of its runtime, and fine dose of tears as well but at its heart, Dead Poets Society is all about making your lives extraordinary. And the only way to live that life is by following your heart, pursuing your dreams & seizing every day that comes. Delightfully recommended.",10
Williams is great - everything else was a big let-down,"I finally get around to seeing 'Dead Poets Society' after years of expecting to love it, only to find it was very so-so. I was pretty disappointed to say the least. I never thought my passionate distaste for poetry would get in the way of my enjoyment of the film, but it did. There's an awful lot of poetry talk in this movie. Maybe I was dumb for not seeing it coming.

I also expected a lot more screen time for Robin Williams than I got. He's the one saving grace in this film and yet it feels like he's barely ever in it. All the focus is on the schoolboys and they are about the least interesting set of characters I've seen in a film.

Also, there are almost no women in this movie. Apparently there was one with a minor role, but even she was cut out. Also there is very little drama in the movie and that which there is towards the end feels very unrealistic and forced.

I went in looking for an inspirational tale and all I got were two long hours of boredom. A generous 5/10 simply for Robin Williams performance and character.",5
Love this whole movie,"This movie was an instant 10/10 from me. Normally I'm not one for movies without much action but this movie changed me. This movie was made in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir. It is meant to take place in the year 1959-1960. It is about a group of school boys who learn to rebel against the status quo and find meaning in life with the help of their new poetry teacher (played by Robin Williams).

This film is heartwarming (until the last 30 minutes). I would highly recommend watching it if you have the time.

Warning: you will become obsessed with it and think about it all the time and make those around you watch it...",10
"Carpe Diem, The Unforgettable Journey","""Dead Poets Society"" stands as a timeless cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the themes of passion, individuality, and the pursuit of authenticity in the face of societal norms. Set in an elite all-boys preparatory school, the film follows the transformative journey of a group of students under the guidance of their unorthodox English teacher, Mr. Keating, portrayed brilliantly by the late Robin Williams.

The performances in the film are nothing short of extraordinary, with each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their respective roles. Robin Williams delivers a tour de force performance as Mr. Keating, capturing the essence of a teacher whose unorthodox methods ignite a spark of inspiration in his students. The young ensemble cast, including Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles, shines in their portrayal of the conflicted and vulnerable adolescents navigating the complexities of adolescence and identity.

While ""Dead Poets Society"" may unfold at a more leisurely pace compared to modern cinema, its deliberate pacing allows for a deeper exploration of its themes and characters. Every scene is imbued with meaning and significance, inviting viewers to reflect on their own lives and choices.

In the end, ""Dead Poets Society"" stands as a testament to the power of art, literature, and mentorship in shaping the lives of individuals. It serves as a poignant reminder to embrace our passions, challenge the status quo, and live authentically, no matter the obstacles we may face. As such, it remains a cinematic gem that continues to resonate with audiences across generations, cementing its status as a timeless classic and a must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration and emotional depth in cinema.",8
Great Movie and meaningful contents too,"Wow!the story was great and interesting to me,well recommended by me,trust me that movie is fantastic but if you understand what's actually happening,especially focus on the Latin word""Carpe Diem""that's the main theme of the story.technically the movie just urge everyone to precise their life and time.seize the day is the exact word to describe it.Don't let your time fly without wings,just spread your wings and fly as high as you could,don't reluctant to do whatever you want;or else you gonna regret it later on in the future.In the story,one of the boy was in love with a girl that already engage but he couldn't get his mind out of her,but finally he make use of the Carpe Diem term to seize his guts to call her.That's some of the parts that caught my attention,wish you to find out more,just graps the movie and seize the day with it,you'll love it.",10
Teaches a lot,"Dead Poets Society criticizes the strict, orthodox teaching methods, by using the Welton Academy in Vermont as a representative. Mr. Keating, an English teacher, teaches his students to be free-thinkers, without mentioning the consequences. That way the movie does not only criticize tradition but also teaches the risks of Carpe Diem (Seize the day).

It features Robin Williams as John Keating, Norman Lloyd as Headmaster Gale Nolan, Kurtwood Smith as Mr. Perry, George Martin as Dr. Hager and many more.

John Keating is played very convenient by Robin Williams. He plays the role of a modern, calm teacher and mirrors the future of teaching.

This movie is great, if you want to learn about Carpe Diem but also want a proving example why it is not always right and that you have to know the consequences.

Movies to watch after Dead Poets Society are: -Good Will Hunting (1997) -Sixteen Candles (1984) -Dazed and Confused (1993) -Easy A (2010) -The Edge of Seventeen (2016) -The Perks of Being A Wallflower (2012) -A Beautiful Mind (2002)",8
Truly Moving and Inspiring,"If someone has not been deeply moved and inspired by such a wonderful film as ""Dead Poets Society"", I really don't know what can do the trick for him/her... ""DPS"" was the nice surprise of the late 80s: Appeared out of nowhere (no big-time promotion, smallish budget, not-very-well-known actors at that time apart from Robin Williams) and instantly stole the hearts and minds of virtually everybody who watched it. Within a short while, ""carpe diem"" and ""oh captain, my captain"" became familiar and beloved phrases. Moreover, the film became a legend for its spirit of free-thinking and its message of ""seizing the day"" and managing one's destiny.

""DPS"" is about a newly-arrived teacher Mr. Keating (Williams) into Welton, a traditional, respected, and rigid school in the late 50s. Not only is Mr. Keating himself a graduate from ""Hell-ton"", but he is also carrying with him a free-thinking and innovative style which is utterly incompatible with the ways the Welton pupils had been used to. The professor transmits his magic to his pupils, including among others Todd Anderson (Hawke), the shy brother of a famous Welton graduate, and his room-mate, Neil Perry (Leonard), a talented boy who is kept under the wings of an oppressive father. Mr. Keating's magic transforms his boys' beliefs and ideals, but unfortunately not all good things in life last forever...

Williams is simply unforgettable as Mr. Keating, a role which for many people (including me) has been forever associated with him. What is even more striking, is the astonishing performance of all the young boys: From the then-unknown Ethan Hawke, to Gale Hansen as Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton, and of course, to Robert Sean Leonard as Mr. Keaton's star pupil, Neil Perry.

This is a movie everyone should watch: It may have no dazzling shoot-outs and special effects, star actors and sexy actresses, and all the other usual Hollywood block-buster elements, but it is one of those films that you never forget. 10/10.",10
"There are powerful moments towards the end, but other than that I found it surprisingly empty and boring","English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) has a rather unorthodox approach to teaching (which raises a few eyebrows in the early stages). Worse is to follow when a group of students find Keating's book and learn about his involvement in The Dead Poets Society (essentially Keating and his fellow students going against the grain). When Keating divulges what The Dead Poets Society is all about the students are intrigued and decide to form their own Dead Poets Society, but will all of this come at a cost?

I hadn't seen Dead Poets Society before but wanted to give it a chance due to its high rating and because it starred Robin Williams (an actor who can be brilliant when given the right material). What really surprised me about this film is how empty and boring it felt to me for the majority of its running time.

I think the major problem I had with this film is that there was nothing really driving the narrative forward; if you look at films like To Sir With Love and Dangerous Minds they focus on students who are initially rebellious and end up being won over by a teacher and their unorthodox teaching methods which means that there is something there to move the story along i.e character shifts and character progression. In Dead Poets Society you don't really get any of that; the kids here seem far too accepting of Keating and his quirky and unorthodox teaching methods which doesn't give the film much of a sense of realism and doesn't make a lot of the classroom scenes all that involving.

Even coming away from the classroom the film still failed to make any kind of impression on me; the kids form a Dead Poets Society and read poetry to one another in some kind of alcove, but I didn't get much out of any of this I'm afraid; no major insights from the characters and no real interesting dialogue. Despite there being a good number of students only 2 of them are given any real development; Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Jim Carrey here and Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles). The former with his overbearing father dictating how he should live his life and the latter with his obsession with a cheerleader who is dating a jock. Both are coming-of-age story arcs, but the latter is rather trite and uninteresting whereas the former is a more interesting thread albeit a tad clichéd in all honesty. Whilst neither of these story arcs are brilliant, they do at least provide the film with some much needed character development and momentum.

Still having said all that the film isn't all bad; the cast are likeable enough (the film boasts an early appearance from a very young Ethan Hawke). Robin Williams is always a welcome presence in any film and does a solid enough job here (although I must confess that I think he has been better in several other films). There are some powerful moments towards the end of the film and the final scene shown in the film is iconic and memorable.

However, for me, Dead Poets Society, for the most part was rather dull and uninvolving - I also found it rather repetitive which also added to the tedium. For me, there were simply too many negatives and not nearly enough positives.",3
Tragic yet Beautiful,"Poignant, powerful, and moving, 'Dead Poets Society' had me grinning out of pure joy and happiness for most of the movie before delivering a hammer blow and turning into one of the most profound tragedies in cinema, (almost) reducing me to tears As with many movies starring Robin Williams, this film aims to breathe life into a world that refuses to acknowledge the power and beauty that resides within the human spirit; carrying a message that becomes increasingly important day by day. Perhaps the aspect I was impressed by the most was how entertaining it managed to remain throughout its entire runtime, with each character having his 0wn development arc that contributed to the plot. Overall, a beautiful story that blends the typical coming-of-age genre with a fusion of melancholic joy, 'Dead Poets Society' is truly timeless.",10
O Captain ! My Captain !,"Dead Poets Society drew me in from the very beginning. This captivating film stands apart from other movies as one of those rare, inspirational films with the power to change your life. I very much enjoyed watching this coming-of-age film about a group of boys on their transition to adulthood. Brilliantly made, the reality of the boys' eventful lives will make you laugh and make you cry. I loved it and after seeing this film, it now holds a place in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.",10
I love this film SO MUCH!!!,"'Dead Poets Society' is definitely one of those films that you recommend in hopes that the other person gets it. It presents heavy factors of mental health and how it is overlooked within teenagers and the factor of feeling like you belong. For this, Dead Poets Society has been one of my comfort films.

It's widely shown factors of mental health signify a lot to me as a person. Dead Poets Society is one of those films that as a teenager you can feel understood watching as someone who isn't understood apart from it. As someone from a traditional and strict family, this film means a lot to me. I grew up in and out of therapy and the films factors of not belonging at the start of the film resonate heavily with myself unfortunately, but i think without this film I wouldn't be who I am or be as hopeful as I am as a person.

Its character of Keating is especially important as it shows how some students may have a close bond or look up to many of their teachers. I grew up with quite weak role models and for that i got attached to many of my teachers throughout the years of my school life, which don't get me wrong is sad, but it provoked me to work harder in those lessons and have someone to work for. Although it is sad that a lack of parental relationships does usually result to this, I think these teachers made me who I am as a person today. And I love the fact that this is shown as a key theme throughout this film.

Overall, I will never stop watching this film as it brings me such comfort and helped me have hope throughout such hard time. I know that sounds weird but sometimes when reality isn't great, people look for hope within fiction and this is where I found it. I love this film so very much!",10
"oh captain, my captain","As a Robin Williams fan, i'd have to say that this is one of his best movies and also the best movie that i've seen to date. The poetry is amazing, the acting is amazing and the movie is directed in such a way as to fully portray the story. I also think Keating was set up, does anyone else?",10
Carpe Diem: The Undying Inspiration of Dead Poets Society,"Dead Poets Society is a masterful celebration of individuality, creativity, and the unrelenting pursuit of passion. Peter Weir crafts a story that transcends time, delivering a film that speaks to the hearts of dreamers and rebels alike.

Robin Williams shines as an unconventional teacher whose charisma and wisdom ignite a spark in his students, encouraging them to see the world-and themselves-with fresh eyes. The ensemble cast delivers heartfelt performances, capturing the raw vulnerabilities and aspirations of youth with remarkable authenticity.

What makes Dead Poets Society truly extraordinary is its resonance across generations. It's not merely a story of rebellion or growth but a testament to the power of ideas and the courage it takes to follow one's voice. Uplifting, thought-provoking, and timeless, the film stands as a call to embrace life fully and unapologetically. A true cinematic treasure.",9
lack of personal views,"A thin good idea but overwhelmed by too many american ""good"" feelings... About Robin Williams, I should advise that excess is often insignificant !",5
Hit me emotionally!,"Wow, what a gem of a movie!

I didn't know what to expect going in...but I ended up feeling emotionally stirred.

The dialogue is well written and for the most part, the characters act and talk in believable ways. I really think that was one of the things I liked best in this movie. Kudos to the writers and actors.

Robin Williams was fantastic in this role!

I feel like this movie is just as impactful today as it must have been when it first came out. If you are looking for a movie that can make you think and feel, give this one a shot. It's one of the best movies I've seen a while! I might just have to watch it again!",10
One of the actual iconic movies,"I honestly give this movie ten stars because it was really iconic and great acting it we had such deep massage in this movie like the important role of the teachers and how can the teachers be like an actual fathers How the classmates can be like brothers !

And how can you find what you actually love to take it as path of life !

The point that makes me think twice is that . Old teachers do not welcome the new and unconventional method, and on the contrary, they fight this type of education. The rest of the idea is the events after the film and how the characters ended up makes me think a lot after the movie.",10
One of the Greatest Movies I've Ever Seen,"I took this movie off of my grandmother's hands to own without ever having watched it before, so of course, I was a bit suspicious when I popped this into my VCR last night. My suspicions soon melted and I found myself captivated with one of the most extraordinary movies I've ever seen.

Robin Williams portrays new English teacher John Keating. He's not like the other teachers, who simply lecture information. He displays his lessons through charm, spite, and action, encouraging his students to ""Cease the day! Make your lives extraordinary!"" He tries to encourage free thinking among his students when the other teachers try to shoot that down.

He especially garners the interest of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a free spirit who's held down by the rules and hardness of his father (Kurtwood Smith), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), who lives somewhat in the shadow of his brother and has a timid, shy streak, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), the rebel of the group, and their friends. When they find that Mr. Keating was once in a mysterious club, called The Dead Poets Society, they decide to resurrect this club among themselves. This club, Mr. Keating, and their friendship arouse unknown talents and creativity from inside.

This movie was great in every possible way. Robin Williams once again showed us his versatility playing fun-loving but serious at heart John Keating. My personal favorite was Robert Sean Leonard, who perfectly displayed for this movie's audience the ambition and spirit that Neil had within, but which would immediately go into hiding when he'd be intimidated by his father. All of the teenagers were excellent in this movie.

The camera work was beautiful. The turns, the angles, everything just made you get into the story. The musical score had the same effect. Whatever emotion was supposed to be making up the scene, you felt it when that score was played.

This is Peter Weir's masterpiece at the moment. Truly a great film. This has successfully made my top 2 (at #2). 10 out of 10. How this film lost at the Academy Awards, I'll never know.",10
A suprisingly dramatic and heartwarming tale.,"I went into this movie without knowing anything and I felt like it was the best thing to do. Peter Weir's Dead Poet's Society is an elegent, heart-warming movie about seezing the day, with great performances thoughout. The movie at first seems to go in a direction that is a massive cliche in Hollywood, but it completelty changes our expectation and does something tottaly different to what I have seen form this cliche. I was vastly shocked by the out come from that and it just completely made the movie entrierly different. I 100% recommened this film.. One of the best Robin Willliams performaces I have seen.",10
Important to watch.,"It's easy to recognize the cinematic brilliance of ""Dead Poets Society"". The script is dripping with insightful dialog and dramatic nuance, and director Peter Weir drew out distinctly emotional performances from his entire cast, particularly Robin Williams, who has never given a finer performance. That's all easy to observe. What's less apparent but definitely there is the importance of this film with respect to our daily lives. This picture does not exist solely for the purpose to entertain (which it does manage to do fantastically), but also to stress the influence of both conformity and individuality on one's life.

The story tracks the events of a group of students of a New England boarding school. The boys are inspired by the powerful example of their English teacher and free spirit, John Keating (Williams), to initiate a secret club that sneaks off to read poetry in the woods after hours. Be not fooled by this seemingly hokey premise. As the boys become engulfed by their new-found sense of nonconformity, so will you become engulfed by the story and its characters.

But only once film is finished will you appreciate how precious your individuality is, and just how much some have to sacrifice to attain theirs.

Whether you're a conscious individual, someone struggling to find their own voice, or just have a real passion for great poetry, it is doubtless that the message of ""Dead Poets Society"" is one that can speak to you.

Carpe Diem!",10
Overblown pap,"His film takes itself way too seriously. It is so pretentious with its philosophical discussions of life and poetry. I find it hard to believe that a bunch of horny teenage boys would meet up at night to read poetry. And if Robin Williams said ""carpe diem "" one more time, I would have screamed. A boring film that is forced down the throats of all high school English students by their teachers who fantasize about being Professor Keating and who run around shouting ""carpe diem"" as though it were the greatest, most inspirational quote since God said ""let there be light""",4
Carpe Diem (seize the day)!,"This movie has a real message-if you´re not watching movies for thinking about them, then check out another movie.

But anybody that doesn´t run away after hearing the word ""poetry"" and maybe likes movies that have a real intention should sit back and enjoy this excellent movie, and afterwards think about what it could mean to himself.

""Respect to you, oh my captain, Peter Weir""",10
The performances make this film!,"Even if this movie DOES border on the melodramatic at times, the moving and exceptional performances by all involved certainly earn it merit. Robin Williams, (in an unusually controlled role), plays John Keating, an English teacher, who returns to his former prep school, breathing life into an otherwise stoic and dull English course. Encouraging his pupils to ""seize the day"", he stirs them to look beyond the confinements of whom they are told they should be, to that which they could and truly wish to become. Thriving under Keating's tutelage are Neil Perry (exceptionally well portrayed by Leonard), who discovers a passion for acting, and, as my friend Laura puts it, ""the painfully shy"", Todd Hamilton (Ethan Hawke could not have been better as the agonizing Todd). Conflicts arise however, when school officials and parents disagree with these new attitudes and work ethics, and strive to dimiss them. Albeit a tad slow in parts, stick with this film to end. The last scene is worth the wait.",9
The Poetry of Freedom: The Enduring Spirit of Dead Poets Society,"Dead Poets Society is a heartfelt ode to individuality, passion, and the transformative power of art. Directed by Peter Weir, the film invites viewers into a world where words have weight, and inspiration has the potential to alter destinies.

Robin Williams delivers a magnetic performance, radiating warmth and authenticity that elevates every scene. His portrayal of an unconventional mentor reminds us of the importance of challenging norms and finding our unique voice. The ensemble cast, filled with youthful exuberance, grounds the story with sincerity and relatability.

What sets Dead Poets Society apart is its ability to resonate deeply across generations. It's not just a film but a call to action-a reminder to seize the day, embrace courage, and honor the beauty of self-expression. Timeless and deeply moving, it's a cinematic treasure that leaves an indelible mark on the soul.",9
So boring & overrated,"This film kinda boring for me, not only the plot is messed up so that i dont even know who's the main character, or what actually they do. If they can focus on 1 of 2 person, maybe it will be better, like in school ties..",2
YES I'M THE GUY WHO NEVER WRITE A REVIEW.,"Yes I'm the guy who never write a review about any film.

I want to tell you that you may not like it because it's not a typical movie about hero winning in the end. This movie is life. It strikes on my head so hard because I just realized I'm just a guy who never did anything unexpected because there are judges everywhere I go. I want to approach a girl I like but never did it because of consequences.

But now I don't think consequences could give me this much pain, that just not listening to my heart did.

But not after this.

NOT. AFTER. THIS.

Carpe Diem.",10
This movie!,I love it so so much! Such a classic with such a meaning!,10
A stunning and historically significant work of art.,"I've actually seen complaints about this film that point out that it is not very funny. Oddly enough, the film isn't a comedy, so I'm surprised anyone would expect it to be funny. Dead Poets Society is a graceful and elegant melodrama centered around the coming of age of young prep school boys through the discovery of the souls of dead poets in their classic works.

Robin Williams injects much needed levity with bits that absolutely must have been ad-libbed as only he could. The Marlon Brando and John Wayne impressions are simply side-splitting. But it is in his dramatic moments you see that Williams range is far wider than the comedic fare for which he is known. In fact, it is those moments of cunning insight and biting wit that few actors can create where Williams' finest work lies. There is no shortage of such moments here.

This is not the typical kids acting like idiots in school lame groaner that most high school films are. It is intelligent and insightful, woven around disparate young men dangerously involved in the discovery of self. And dangerous it is, as discovery often reveals hidden conflict.

Robert Sean Leonard is simply stunning. His conflicted portrayal of a boy whose father's expectations are not aligned with his own dreams culminates in one of the most unforgettable scenes in the genre. Ethan Hawke is beautifully brittle as a young boy about to enter his own maturity.

If you don't have tears in your eyes at the final scene, you should be forbidden by law ever to watch another movie in your life. So many people live lives of quiet desperation, and if you ever had a teacher, or ever were that teacher, who encouraged young minds to seize the day, this is a film you will always treasure for the towering accomplishment it is.

Director Peter Weir litters the scenery with insider jokes and symbols present in all his films, and if you don't know them or get them, you won't miss a thing. His body of work is nonetheless historically significant, and this could be the jewel in his crown.",10
Excellent...,"I am so much surprised when i see that this movie takes 7.7.It deserves much much over it.It is certainly in my top 10. Excellent characters, flawless scenario and a wonderful end. It is my first comment on this page and this movie is actually the reason why i am registered...You will for sure question your life after u watch it. This movie is not only to have a nice evening but also to question your life. The center of the movie is ""Carpe diem"" (sieze the life), which a few of us can achieve in these days. When i feel that my life is not going on as I wish, I am always re-watching this masterpiece. It always works on me. I suggest you, whatever your age is, to buy and watch this movie. You will not be regretful. Believe me. This movie is just PERFECT",10
Beautiful and interesting,"'Dead Poets Society' is a beautiful movie from start to finish. The movie tells the story of a new English teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), who is a lot different than other teachers. He wants the students to think for themselves although other teachers disagree with this vision. They think a boy that is 17 years old is not able to think for himself. You can imagine how the story develops; the students like Mr. Keating, the other teachers don't.

Mr. Keating teaches poetry to the students, and inspires some of them to do things they never thought they would do. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) discovers that his real passion is acting, and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) learns he can do a lot more than he thought he could. There is also a story line involving a student named Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is in love with a girl and because of Mr. Keating he tries to win her over. Of course things can't go right and some tragic events happen. I will not reveal them here. May be they are not very surprising but they do have an impact.

Robin Williams as the smart and funny teacher has one of his finest roles here. He is known as a funny guy, but as in 'Good Will Hunting' he finds the perfect way for this part. The students are all very good as well, especially Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen, who plays a guy named Charlie Dalton. The fine direction by Peter Weir completes this very beautiful and interesting movie.",9
Something to look for,I had this improvement exam for BA. III (English 3 papers). I had to read 9 novels in 5 days. I was pretty tensed and watch this movie for some motivation. Well this movie brought my childhood feelings back to me when I used to feel the poems and imagine the stories in my mind. It was a beautiful movie for literature.,9
Seize the Day indeed...,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a remarkable film, and one that I simply cannot praise or recommend enough. Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, a new teacher at a private boys school in 1959. His unorthodox teaching methods, designed to make his pupils more aware of the topics and to encourage them to open up to each other more, are viewed with apprehension and derision by his work colleagues but begin to leave an impression on each of his pupils. They soon go on to start a 'Dead Poets Society', in which they go into the woods at night and read poetry to each other. However, tragedy strikes and Keating's teaching is thought to be to blame by the other members of staff.

Amusing, compelling and often moving, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a wonderfully acted piece with a good young cast (including Ethan Hawke in an early role). Most exceptional of all is Robin Williams who plays his role of the inspirational leader to a group of people at a crossroads in their lives to absolute perfection, proving once and for all that not only is he one of the greatest comedy performers of all time, he is equally adept at playing it straight, and he certainly deserves to be recognised more for his talents.

If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do, you won't be disappointed.",10
This is an important movie,This movie left me with a real bittersweet feeling at the ending I hadn't really experienced in a movie before. The cast is all great. This is my favorite live action performance by the late Robin Williams.,8
"Please Don't Make Me Gag, Mr. Chips","A message about the value of non-conformity comes packaged in an utterly formulaic and treacly film.

""Dead Poets Society"" belongs to that genre of films about an unconventional teacher who becomes a major figure in the lives of his students. Usually these movies end with the teacher either dying or leaving his position for some reason or another, but almost invariably we must endure a scene where the music swells and his students applaud him in unison.

Robin Williams stars as the teacher in this one, and the Academy gave him a Best Actor nomination because he cried.

Grade: C+",5
Absolutely The Best Classic Movie.,"This film makes me cry,lots of dramatic dialogue and moments in this film.this film is fit to plays in schools because this film very educate the students to always take the opportunities in life.",10
Believable and Well-Done-- Recommended Reading for Further Understanding of Film,"I found that all of the characters are reminiscent of people I have known in my short lifetime. I could not recommend this more highly. If you enjoyed this, there are some books and movies I would recommend you read and watch as well. To Kill a Mockingbird (book and movie) and Send Me Down a Miracle by Han Nolan. I would also recommend reading a few poems by Walt Witman and Robert Frost, as well as A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare BEFORE seeing this movie-- no worries, these tell nothing about the storyline. This piece was beautifully written and acted; a testament to both the best and the worst of human traits.",10
Sublime,"This is quite simply the finest film ever made. There are movies I call my favorites, there are movies I have memorized, there are movies I watch again and again. They may be fun, but there has never, since the invention of the genre, been a film as powerful, as sublime as this one.",10
I'd Seize the Day with the Dead Poets,"Super inspiring movie with great characters and easy to hate antagonists. As a younger inspired youth I really feel for this movie, and the time you must give to you dreams and passions even if people aren't supportive. This films lightly follows what it can be like to be trapped by the horrible, and for some unbearable control freak parents. Watch these boarding school brothers fight adversity, find their passion for all art, and the urge to seek names etched in history.",10
"Wonderful, touching, extraordinary","This movie is outstanding. Robin Williams never gets enough credit for his acting ability. This movie is extremely well done as he plays a renegade teacher who teaches his students lessons in life that they will never forget. This movie seems to get better each time I have seen it. If you liked this, you may also enjoy ""With Honors."" 10 Stars.",10
There are extremely memorable lessons you can find in this movie,"The dead poet's society is such an outstanding drama that can change ones' perspective on their life. Set in high school time, there is a genius teacher that is eager to make his students' life extraordinary. Believing that everyone has their own success, he strove for bringing out the best in their students with anything he can do, such as explaining the things in a way that can make students understand the most. There are some important lessons from this drama. One of them, which most of the people took the lesson of, is Carpe Diem, which basically means seize the day. However, there's a more valuable thing that I think people are likely to overlook it, and that is to always look at something in a different way which is illustrated by the teacher standing on his desk. This is very constructive because when we only look at something in a particular way and don't try to observe in other way, we can't have full picture of that thing. It is like if we only see an elephant from front view for the whole of our life, we never know that elephant is big until we die. In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie and get many memorable lesson from it.",9
Great film,"Great film. Robin Williams plays a professor of poetry, John Keating at the prestigious Welton School, with a management making sufficient hay with the schools continual academic shine. His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating, the deans soon latch on to the one opportunity(or mis-opportunity I must say) that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession. The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality. A young Ethan Hawke playing an even younger student redeems his professors every drop of sweat

Seize the day!,"""Seize the day"" Did you ever think about the days you wasted with things which weren´t worth your time ? How short your life could be ? Are you aware of the fact that time is something you can´t buy, change or repeat ? Now you are thinking ""Of course, everybody knows that"" but do you think that you know the worth of it ? You should watch the ""Dead Poets Society"" because this movie will show you something you probably didn´t see or realise until now.

The movie ´Dead Poets Society´ starring Robin Williams is based on a real teacher who taught the screenwriter Tom Schulman. It is about a traditional and strict school where a lot of pressure is put on it´s students. Mr Keating, the new English teacher inspires the boys with literature but doesn´t think about the dramatical consequences this could have.

There are a lot of interesting characters in the movie but there are three characters which are really inspiring to me. First there is Keating of course. He inspires his students to come out of themselves and to think about the important things in life. Then there is Neil Perry. He has a strong personality and because of Keating he gets more self confident during the movie. He is popular but doesn´t get conceited, he helps others and can stand against the crowd. And then there´s Todd. I like this character the most because I can identify myself with it. Todd is a shy person and definetly not the type to be a a leader. He has a lot to say but he is scared of others. He is scared that they are going to make fun of him or that his voice will get lost in the crowd.

Even if it´s not the type of movies I normally watch I think it´s a movie you should have watched at least once in your life. It points out some important things about life and you shouldn´t miss that. The director wants to show how important every day we live, every thought we have and every step we do can be and we should open our eyes and realise that this movie is a message to all of us that we should finally wake up and live! So make sure you watch it and think about it.",10
I'd rated it lower if it was an anime,"Maybe it was good in 1989, but it didn't age well. The story is banal, characters are bland, teacher's methods do nothing of what teacher claims to cultivate - students don't think on their own, but only follow teacher's antics. Lines from poems, conveniently derived of the context, celebrate the movie idea - while meaning opposite as a whole. The only thing why it's different from mediocre anime - the setting.",4
"""And not when I had come to die, discover I had not lived.""","I use this quote on a regular basis. It always reminds me of Dead Poets' Society and to ""seize the day"" and make my life extraordinary. I saw this movie when I was 14 and it is my favorite drama ever. I love Robin Williams and his work here is incredible. He would be the person I would cast to be a ""non-traditional"" teacher. He has his bits of humor here but he also brings class to the film and adds to the traditional flavor of the picture, even though he is supposed to be non-traditional. Wonderfully portrayed, I must say.

I am an actress and very involved in theatre. It is my life and my love. After seeing Robert Sean Leonard's character, Neil, go through the changes and realizations that he does in the film, I am so glad that I am able to do what I love through theatre and that I have the freedom to make the choice to do so. Neil is a wonderfully gifted person and anyone who has been denied something they loved can sympathize with him. Leonard portrays such an eloquent, likeable and feeling character that I instantly was drawn into his struggle in the film. Like Williams, Leonard does a wonderful job here as well.

Overall, this film is incredible. The essence of it is so intense and powerful that if you did not feel any different after seeing it then you haven't discovered that you have not lived yet and that you still have to ""make your life extraordinary!""",9
A touching movie of people's trials and dreams.,"I cry everytime I see this movie. Dead Poets Society has such great acting in it. Robing Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and Josh Charles all shine in this show of emotions. This movie shows how people can be pressured into things they don't want to do and the dreams that people have. It shows that dreams can come true if you believe. The only problem with Leonard's character is he lets his father get to him. Wow! What a great movie though. Though provoking. CARPE DIEM! SIEZE THE DAY!",10
Carpe Diem....,"Being a student was always a tough period for me. Lots of expectations, and lots of commitments, and I never really asked myself what will become of me in the next 10 or 20 years. There weren't much of a mentor for me except a few movies like 'Dead Poet's Society'. consider the scene from the movie, in which the satisfaction provided by a poem is plotted as a mathematical expression. Ironically, our lives are somewhat similar. There are teachers who will give us the knowledge about the stuff explained on the text books, but a few will dare to show us the real lessons of life. Thus, dead poets society acts as a mirror to our consumerist society. The liberation should be started from schools, and they should provide sane citizens instead of ATM machines. I always believe in movies which provides some social conscience. Even if the movie is about the relationship between a few students and their beloved teacher, we can see ourselves in them. Souls which are trying to break out from chains. Robin William's Keating, Robert Leonard's Neil, and Ethan Hawke's Todd will remain with us even after we left the movie. That is the real victory of a movie. No wonder 'Carpe Diem' is considered as one of the greatest movie quotes...",9
Pure art.,"It is beautiful. So soft yet so strong. Excellent performances.

Also, is it the inspiration for Mohabbatein? Obviously DPS is more realistic and subtle. But for me Mohabbatein is equally beautiful with all its over dramatic performances, pointless songs, and many illogical elements. I love it with all its faults. On the other hand, DPS is pure art.",8
Masterpiece,"It really open your eyes, you can watch to this movies message in so many different ways.",10
Carpe Diem,"""The Dead Poets Club"" is one of the films that have marked me the most in my life, in the sense that it presents a philosophy and a way of understanding human existence, which I think we should all follow at the foot of the letter. The character who so masterfully represents Robin Williams, offers us the guidelines and the keys to a full development and a vision of life, where there always reigns optimism, joy, good humor and honorability. Take advantage of the moment, do not get tired of repeating the teacher protagonist and that is what we should do at all times, stay with the good and discard the bad, not give up, fight for the ideals and at the end of everything, when the days are we can exhaust ourselves, be able to look back and think calmly, that truly, our passage through this world left some trace, since we took the opportunity to live. It is worth trying to be happy in this valley of tears. A work of art in short and a real wonder from all points of view, so if there is still someone who has not seen it, it is taking too long.

Carpe Diem, comrades!",10
...not a good choice in this era.,Must have been a landmark back then. Its an anarchonism now. A bit disappointed as a high rated movie.,2
amazing,Possible the best Robin Williams film. For me it's either this or Good Morning Vietnam a movie that if it doesn't make you feel there may be something wrong with you.,9
"not funny, cried (also it's definitely gay)",I wanted to not like this film just because of how overrated i thought it was and the excessive amount of men in it. However! I absolutely did freaking cry like a child during the last 30 minutes.,9
"OH, CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN","Staged entirely within the secular ambiance of a Boarding School where values such as tradition, honor, discipline and excellence are stressed out, `Dead Poets Society' proposes a critical analysis of the system's preaching of a line of indoctrination close to that of populism where freedom and variety of choice are guaranteed to those who condescend to the system's pre-selected choices.

Concomitantly, several facets of social incongruence interplay within the depicted social strata proportionally to the expansion of the characters' inter-dynamics.

Furthermore, stereo-typification among the characters denounces the existence of oppression within the oppressed, an empirical trait probably osmotically absorbed from the macro-sphere, setting equal grounds for all dissimilar plans which will develop within the story.

The most fundamental argument therein, nonetheless, lies in pondering the purpose of life as to its finality while keeping the value of altruism omnipresent. Thus, a powerful argument as to the symbiotic interrelation between qualification and quantification is set as to overshadow all other disseminating lines of thought throughout the story, a point whose substantiality is intertextually argued under the pretense that lyricism cannot and must not be scientifically equated as any attempt in accepting such equating would signify a loss of perspective on one's humanity.

Nevertheless, it is further argued that daring will necessarily lead to knowledge which, in turn, will lead to empowerment; leading, thus, to dissent from the system's coercions; a paradox which dictates the empowerment of the individual through sound analytical thought to be the only way to commune from authentic freedom, a byproduct only achievable through non-compliance and non-conformance to the pre-established.

The correlation between the authority of the overseer and the humiliation of the overseen is one portrayed as omnipresent. It is further argued that abuse of power by the overseer will generate morbidity of the social dynamics among the overseen and that, in order to withstand successful opposition to the overseer, the camaraderie amongst the overseen must accommodate the vulnerability of the self as to denote acceptance of individual differences and subsequent intra-micro-sphere maturation, further recognizing the possibility of simplicity while concurrently denying the plausibility of ordinary.

Dictating that a certain level of anarchy is necessary within each individual, it is also demonstrated, nonetheless, that should no conscious attention be paid to the social development a micro-sphere, it will become tribal and, once self-actualized, it is likely to exhibit patterns of behavior analog to those objected in mother-sphere.

Altruism, which is an essential component to the dissent from the overseer's oppression, will lead to personal sacrifice, whose extent should be accurately conveyed as to the capability and finality of each individual and action respectively given ultimate altruism will lead to ultimate frustration, leading, in turn, to a refraction as to the sense of personal empowerment.

Carpe Diem!",10
"My favourite movie ever, and it's incredibly Identifiable","This movie is about being whoever you want to be, is about to being happy without thinking tomorrow or yesterday, it's about life lessons. I felt as I was the main character (Neil), sometimes I was Todd, and sometimes I was everybody and that's the magic thing that this movies has for me, it's purely identifiable. ""Oh captain, my captain, enjoy the emotional wave""",10
Food for thoughts,"Dead poets society is a 1989 film talks about poetry and life put together. This movie illustrates how poetry comes to life .and it's very inspirational . The movie is slow and some viewers may find it to be boring at some point.this movie teaches us to follow our desire in life.this comedy/ drama movie is very absorbing am telling you,so give it chance, watch it and you will understand what poetry is all about.at some point you can cry because of this movie.and the characters , they were into deep character.thats what every movie must have.si recommend every one to watch it and come and give your review.",5
"I dont need a sentence , one word (AWESOME) should do it.","The movie is superb, as are many 80s flicks. The whole point, I think, is not only to live life to the fullest, but as he says, ""The dangers of conformity"". Not to say you should go out of your way to be a complete trouble starting idiot, but conforming to everything takes the fun out of life, a true non-conformist can be EXTREME in his lack of conformity and not cause ANY trouble, but actually draw people to him/her and have loads of fun. He tries to teach them to be as unique and ambitious as possible. Non conformity can be the key to life! (when used under a parents supervision)...YEAH, RIGHT!!! Im gonna go make a carpe diem shirt right NOW!!! lol",10
Life Changing,"This movie reminds us that we are all special as individuals. In our digital age the pressure to conform is stronger than ever before. One of the very few movies that you can (and should) watch over and over throughout you lifetime.

The timeless message to think for yourself and act instead of wait should be our guiding principle in life. Unfortunately, it is easy to forget, and re-watching this movie is a wonderful way to keep you centered in your busy daily life.",10
"This is a battle, a war, and the casualties could be your hearts and souls.","Dead Poets Society is a drama film directed by Peter Weir. The film stars Late Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles and Late Norman Lloyd.

A progressive English teacher, tries to encourage his students to break free from the norm, go against the status quo and live life unapologetically.

This film was on my bucket list for a long time and i have to admit that my patience paid me very well as this impressively and beautifully crafted masterpiece has satisfied my quench to watch a great realistic film.

The best part of this film is it's more realistic approach and the director should be applauded for trying something different and for coming out from the easier but monotonous and dramatic shell which most of the directors didn't even try. The film will make you laugh and will make you cry. These are the certain types of film in which you try hard to find any flaw but fails to find any and this is such type of film.

The screenplay of the film is evenly paced and will keep you engaged throughout. There are certain scenes which are too slow but will not disrupt the film viewing experience.

Acting in the film is the strongest pillar of the film and all of them deserves a huge round of applause with a very special mention for Robin Williams for playing the character with such an ease and simplicity and in my opinion i can't imagine anyone else playing the role of John Keating.

The climax of the film is equally impressive and gives a very practical and realistic closure to the film.

If you are willing to watch a very beautiful and realistic film than this is the film for you. A must must watch.",10
not up to the hype,"I watched this film because I was told it was a brilliant film, emotional and inspiring etc, and yes there are scenes when that all applied, but overall I was underwhelmed.

The acting was good, although I would say I've seen Robin Williams do better.

I got some of the messages it conveyed about life being short, think for myself and not conform with everyone else's ideals and to seize the day, but overall it failed to inspire me. I will go to work tomorrow feeling no different to how I did this morning, except for wishing that I had watched Good Will Hunting last night instead, because THAT is Robin Williams at his best.

I must confess that after doing English Literature in school then retaking it in college for the grade (another 'D' by the way) I hate poetry. Maybe somewhere in that statement IS part of Dead Poets Society?",3
"Seize the Day, or life...","In the movie, the message is very subliminal. Only after you see the movie you understand ""carpe diem"" or what it actually means. How many of you go the same route to work every day? How many of you notice nature, or people, or animals. How many thank God or somebody else for the great times they have had. We may die tomorrow, a year, or 50 years, but if you died tomorrow would you feel as though your life was complete? Have you helped enough people? Have you seen your family? Or have you acted like a kid lately, skwishing your feet in the mud, or jumping into a pile of leaves? When we grow up it needs to be physical not mental. Every day that passes, we die a little more. Every beat of our heart is one less beat then before.

When we die we need to feel content whether it is helping people, or doing things we want to do, or express ourselves, through music or poetry like in the Dead Poets Society. And when somebody amazing comes along, thank them before it is too late.",10
Inspiring and stimulating,"I loved this film when I was a teenager and still do. Although the story is set in the late fifties the message does not age : to look at things in a different angle, follow your inner voice and contribute your verse, how refreshing !

If you are cynical (or a sheep!), forget this film and save your breath : you haven' t got that sensitivity and you would not understand what it is all about. It is too easy to be cynical about everything. So follow the herd of the cynics who abound these days.

I do not need the help of a guru or a Keating to seize the day. However I like the idea that you should be free of the need to be popular or approved by others to make your life interesting to yourself. More often I believe hell is others, like Sartre would say.

This movie contains some excellent thought-provoking material and gives a poetical philosophy of life as well. It also has great sensitivity, with attaching characters and deeply moving scenes and music. More films like this, please !",9
"if you can laugh, if you can cry, you're still alive","This movie is like a touchstone. If you can laugh, if you are able to cry with it then you are still alive. It is somewhat theatrical, but it is a movie about the poetry, among other things. It says also so much about life and freedom that you are not going to forget it, ever.",10
Great Movie but a bit too long,"I thought that the movie had a good cast, and great performance by everyone. Even thought the movie was almost perfect, it ran out a bit too long, but the more I think of it, I wouldn't cut any part away. The film showed the coming to age of these students and the type of men that each one will become in the future. Even though is only high school, the pressure to mature could be great for most students and in some sense they need a way to dream and to have an output were they could have fun without being supervise or being judge, that's why the society was secret between them. Each student showed a problem or an experience that goes through a teenager's life in one way or the other, but to explain each one will take more than what I'm allow write. I can't emphasis the acting enough, and also the plot was good and flawless.",9
A Truly Great Film,"Dead Poets Society is a truly great film. If you want a film where you can sit back and just watch without thinking, then do NOT see this film. However, if you wish to see a film that shows us to never underestimate ourselves and to always strive for the best, this is the film for you. Robin Williams delivers one his best dramatic performances in a film where he teaches his students that nothing is impossible if they ""Carpe Diam."" If you wish to view an intellectual film that inspires you to achieve, then do yourself a favor and go see this film.",9
A cheat,"It could have been a good film, but it was almost as if Writer #1 wrote up to the play within the play, and then Writer #2 (who only knew how to write clichés and knew nothing about characters or plot development) took over. Why it got any Oscar nominations is beyond me (but then a lot about the Oscar process is beyond me) much less an award for best screenplay????? What, was 1989 a really bad year? The story takes such a wrong turn at the end that the leading character (Keeting) and one huge story line (Knox's romance) just vanish and stock B movie plot and characters are pulled off the shelf and plugged in. I don't get the raves some people give it. The world is full of better films.",5
"Change your thinking and outlook on life, you can be my captain","A masterpiece that teaches crying, passion and cheerfulness, a movie in which you must focus in order to enjoy, full of projections on your life, oh captain, my captain Change your thinking and outlook on life, you can be my captain",10
One of my all time favorite movies,"My sixteen year old daughter and I just finished watching Dead Poets Society (me for the thousandth time), and I've also read some of the comments left. For me, this movie was not about poetry or life in private schools, it is a lesson on standing up (sometimes on a desk) in the face of conformity. From the moment we enter school, we are are taught to sit in a row, be quiet, do not ask questions, do not interrupt the class and on and on. This proves wonderful training for when the young minds leave formal education behind and enter the work world, where you are encouraged to sit quietly, not ask questions and do not interrupt. To have the opportunity to learn from someone who believes that education is more than rot memory and regurgitating facts is indeed spectacular, potentially life-altering and unfortunately rare. What I hold so dear about this movie, is that Keating does this; he teaches the value of individual thought, life, and beauty, and his students in return show their understanding, love and respect in the desk scene in the end.

Young minds all over the world are just waiting to be filled; take care what you fill the with.",10
"Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) is a poetry teacher for a group of boys, and his performance carried the entire movie.","But with the exception of one of the students (Neil), I found most of the students in the cast to be bland, with average performances. I also thought that it was filmed and directed in a Shawshank Redemption sort of style, which works for the movie but isn't compelling or memorable otherwise. The message of the film was touching, the bits of poetry sprinkled in were well chosen and the movie was enjoyable overall, but it could have been so much stronger if the directing and cinematography had more unique character or the rest of the cast was as strong as Williams (Keating) or Leonard (Neil).

Edit: Bumped this up to an 8 because although it could have been more artistic with the way it was shot, the core message, scenes and moments of dialogue had so much heart and after revisiting Good Will Hunting, I think Williams' performance here was absolutely in the same league. Mr. Keating is the kind of character you rarely find in cinema, and this film and its message is something to be treasured.",8
It is movie that will change your life.,"This film hasn't yet changed my life but I know from heart that it will change my life definitely. It is not just about striving to find your own passion, no matter what obstacles you encounter, no matter how hard it is, no matter what other people think of it is; it is also about standing up and guarding your heart and your belief, and not yielding in critical times. To see the world not from the perspective of others, from social norms and cultural constraints, or from everyday angles, but from another angle, the angle of your own. ""Yawk"", a barbaric ""yawk"",from you heart, to the authorities, to the enemies, to the toast for your dream and to the fleeing days of your life.",10
Good classic,"Good classic. Like another great eighties film, Barry Levinson's ""Diner"", ""Dead Poets Society"" is set at the end of 1959. In both films this choice of date has a symbolic significance. The fifties- often seen as a conservative decade- are about to give way to the sixties, the decade of rebellion. The times they are a-changing. Inspired by Keating, a number of boys revive the Dead Poets Society, a secret literary society of which Keating was a member when he was himself a pupil at the school, and try to live up to his ideals. This does not go down well with the school authorities, especially the stern, traditionalist headmaster Mr Nolan, who accuses Keating of encouraging rebellion with his unconventional teaching methods. When I recently watched this film again I was struck by two things which I had perhaps forgotten since I last saw it. The first is how physically beautiful it is. It was filmed in and around an actual academy (in Maryland rather than Vermont) and Peter Weir achieves some striking images of the school's grey Victorian buildings against the colours of the autumn leaves and the winter snows. Particularly memorable was the scene of the lone piper playing by the lake.",8
A rather sentimental tale,"A rather sentimental tale of idealised characters in a highly contrived context. It's neither realistic nor believable, but that's not really the point. It's a film for the romantics and those who like to feel a tug on the heartstrings; for those who will enjoy the weepy ending.

If you can go with it, then the film will serve up the kind of drama you enjoy, but others will find this film far too sickly and sweet.

A harsh judgement may be that the film failed on its own terms. Ultimately the pupils fail to demonstrate the ability to think independently, to act for themselves, to develop their own critical faculties. They absorbed the mush they were spoon fed, and rolled over at the first opportunity to face the challenge.",3
Good Cinematography,"In my opinion the best part of this movie is the costume design and cinematography. Especially cinematography has a prime importance in story telling, and making an iconic movie like Dead Poets Society. John Seale who is cinematographer of this movie also made other successful as English Patient and Rain Man. I like the general vibe and ambiance of this movie, makes me believe I'm watching an usual life of the historical and prestigious boys school and the relationships between students and teachers . At some parts I think the movie moves a little too slow and has some cliché conversations which gives a little a shallow approach but Robin Williams has one of his best performance in this movie.",8
A marvellous film. A must see.,"I consider myself a poet, and since I saw this film for the first time (it must be about four or five now) I consider myself a ""dead poet"". If you don't know what I'm talking about then go rent this video and you'll understand. Words really can change the world --and even if they cannot, they can change our lives, as Werther would have asserted.",10
One of the best movies ever!,"This movie is one of the very few which express the notion of life in an excellent way. When do the greatest personal developments and changes in life occur? It is the period of time being a young adult. Therefore the mere topic is of extremely interest. The movie deals with this topic in a very impressive way. It was a glowing spot in my life as teenager. Going to school can be tough. And this is not restricted to a conservative boarding school in the 50s. Literature can be boring if you are not interested in it (or if you have not seen this movie).

Why poetry? Because we are food for the worms? What does that mean!?

What is passion? What is rebellion? What is life? This movie contains some striking examples to these questions.",10
How a teacher should be.,This is the film that made me fell in love with English literature. The film that made me want to be a teacher. & I'll regret forever for not taking English Literature as my major and for not being a teacher because of this film.,9
So in love with its own perceived sophistication and intellectualism,"This goody-goody picture about an unconventional English teacher who awakens a ""passion"" in his prep school students through literature and poetry was both a commercial and critical success at its time of release, hailed for its dramatic power and Robin Williams' performance. But if you can sit through it without feeling unpleasantly, almost suffocatingly manipulated - not to mention rather cheated - I applaud your tolerance. The script, by Tom Schulman, is so in love with its own perceived sophistication and intellectualism that any concern for truthfulness is flimsily brushed aside. And the director, Peter Weir, never lets his young cast breathe and create discernable characters in their own right. Although Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke look great and demonstrate hints of talent in their parts, their minutely controlled performances reveal them to be puppets for Weir's melodramatic agenda. And the ever so sympathetic Williams is his willing adjutant.",4
It left an impression that has never faded...,"I saw this film when it first came out in 1989 and always remembered it being a good film. Over the years I forgot the story but always remembered it as a film worth seeing. I recently watched it for a second time and was given a certain reminder as to why it's a film worth seeing. It's hard to say what it is that makes it such a good film - most people focus on Robin William's performance as the main ingredient. I have to disagree. There are many aspects of this film that make it worth seeing and all play their part just enough and without blatancy. If any performance had to be singled out for praise I would put Robert Sean Leonard's portrayal of Neil at the front. Neil is clearly the focus for the audience and the one boy in the class who is affected most by their new teacher. He carries the viewer through the events of the film and becomes the reason for its climax. I suppose Williams was the only known actor in the movie at time of its release and so his performance is highlighted. But I'd say his character was only a focal point for the boys in the school, not the viewer. It was Neil who had the main storyline and Robert Sean Leonard carried off perfectly.",9
Catcher in the Rye Vibes,"Extremely difficult to find anything particularly wrong with this movie but I still am unable to give it a full 10/10. All acting was tremendously amazing - especially moments between the parents and children, I could feel goose bumps, like it was the foreboding presence of a parent scolding me. Even the story felt extremely realistic and flowed well, the only complaint is that the climax of the film was difficult to spot, it felt like that there was no high point of the movie.

Overall, a great watch, time well spent.",8
A MASTERPIECE,"Why? Well, hard to say , but after every time i have seen this movie, i discovered something new. It's about a poetry and it's watchable like a poesy. It's about being brave. It's about seizing the day. And if you saw this movie, you certainly seized the day. It's one of this movies, that i would be sad if i missed it. Real sad.

First a lot of credit goes to the great Peter Weir, who certainly know his business, then it's the beautiful scenary and setting, not to mention the Jarre's music. I could mention the actors, but i won't. O.k. maybe in one word. Pure brilliance.

I guess i could talk in superlatives of this movie for hours, but i won't. Watch this movie. And your view on poesy will never be the same.

10 out of 10 Oh Captain, my captain.",10
Captain Oh My Captain,"This movie is a pure masterpiece. I knew I was going to cry during this movie but I didn't expect such emotions going through me. It's all about emotions as how poetry should be. In fact this picture is a poem all by itself.

Like Poetry, it celebrates life and love before anything else. Robin Williams, like a true poet, drives his students and by them, us through what this art represents:not just a question of rhymes and rhythm but life and pleasure. ""We will be worm food whatever happens to us so let's enjoy life till it's still time or Carpe Diem"", That's all the Dead Poet Society is all about: celebrate life.

It's also an ode about the beauty of education and the strong relationship between the students and the teacher. Robin Williams is the teacher who tries and thinks outside the box bringing an entire new dimension to his lectures. He's also treating his students as equal and let them bring life to the course. All the young actors playing the students are also marvelous and so powerful just like their captain Williams is.

This is the kind of movie I so wish to see more often these days. The kind of movies which means something and shares emotions to the people watching it. The kind of movie which will stay in the memory and will never fade away. This is Dead Poets Society one of my ever favorite movies. And also an incredible tribute to the talent and the man named Robin Williams. I sure gonna missing this truly talented actor.",10
Carpe Diem,"So many people spend their lives chasing after meaning, purpose, money, gold or something else.

In that process they forget to live.

And I truly believe that life is about living. There is no higher purpose for our existence - our only obligation is to make the best of our abilities and not to harm other people.

This movie made me realize that fact and changed my point of view. That is basically the best thing you can say about any movie. Go see it please. Rating: 10 of 10.",10
Not impressive,Boring. Sounds like a frankstein with teenager movie and cult movie parts,4
An Average Coming-of-Age Drama That's Lifted by Several Stunning Performances,"A fairly by-the-books tale of adolescence, uncertainty, self-discovery and clashes with authority that rises to greater things on the backs of a few dynamic performances. Central to it all is Robin Williams, of course, in a role that showed the world he could play for more than laughs, but don't overlook the dramatic chops of the kids, either. An extremely young Ethan Hawke is the focus, and he shines, but I found more versatility in Robert Sean Leonard's tragic turn as his brash, social, get- things-done roommate. A setting in the conservative 1950s excuses many of the film's indulgences, grounding it as a period piece with flashes of the cultural revolution that was already on the way, but also adds a certain sense of natural charm and classic Americana to the mix. It can be quite dark, but also very optimistic, and expertly handles that difficult range of emotion through a vast array of concurrent story lines. Very good stuff, though it often feels like it's preaching to the choir.",8
Fabulous,"I love movies and i became a member of that page some time ago. But I am quite lazy and i never comment movies. But this time, while seeing the top 250 list, i got amazed by the ranking of Dead Poets Society. It's certainly on my top 10.

It's not an expensive Hollywood production, I never thought Robin Williams was a great drama actor. But this film has a great story that evolves during the film and has a fabulous emotive conclusion. I never understood when people talked to me they were affected by movies untill i saw this one. I believe its low position in the top 250 is the biggest injustice in this page.",10
One of my favorites,"This is possibly the best film I have ever seen. While I cannot say that it is entirely unique (I even think a lot of movies have borrowed from it), it sums up my belief on life. Carpe Dium, ""Seize the Day!"" is the main message, it has underlying plots of looking at the world from a different perspective, and learning about your own individuality. One thing that I love about this movie is that all of the supporting characters are entirely unique, and you can see each of their personalities shine through. Robin Williams is amazing, as are the other main characters.

As a last note, this is the perfect movie for the Mires-Briggs Jungarian personality type NF, which I am, and you cannot fully appreciate it unless you are such.",10
Amazing movie!!,"The movie ""Dead Poets Society""(1989), set in Vermont in 1959 at Welton Academy written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir is about an elite private boys school where a new teacher named Mr. Keating teaches them to ""seize the day"".

In contrast to all other teachers Mr. Keating´s teaching Methods are unortodox and are based on democratical principles. He tries to teach them to be freethinkers and wants to inspire them but he doesnt think about the consequences.

The most presented characters are Todd Anderson ( Ethan Hawke ), Neil Perry ( Robert Sean Leonard ) and John Keating ( Robin Williams ). Todd Anderson is the new student at the school, he is a shy young man, who has some big shoes to fill because, his brother went to this school before and he was one of the best students. His roommate and friend Neil Perry is the more confident one and supports Todd.

In my opinion it is a great movie, which contains critical aspects. It opends up my mind and made me think about how i should live my life, because living is a beautiful responsibility that we should care about . I started think about some things that are criticised in this movie in another way.",8
watch Wine Country instead,"A solid 4, not very nice Ets a no good, pizza tastes better than this movie. kylie minogue would not enjoy",4
So sooo,I don't even know who to describe something like this all I can say is just watch it ur self,8
No words,"A moving film that reawakens one's desire to follow the most basic desires of one's heart an soul.

A tribute to teachers everywhere who challenge their students beyond traditional methods.",10
The Best Movie Ever,"I saw this movie for the first time in Language Arts in 7th grade, the teacher was the best teacher ever, just like the one on the movie. He's retired now but every time I see the movie it reminds me of him. It's so emotional and so true, it's exactly how teens think and I think it shows everyone to be themselves and not to follow by example. Every time after I see this movie, I'm inspired to go out there and change the world, it's the best!!",10
Great Movie!,"If you're looking for a good drama movie, well, Dead Poets Society will be more than adequate. (And well, I am not surprised that it is such a famous and quite popular film.)

Dead Poets Society is a youth drama film from the late 80s, which incidentally takes place in 1959. To be honest, the entire movie is really really great. Not only is the cast, story, and cinematography is outstanding, but the film has a lot of wise quotes... and it's actually pretty emotional.

In conclusion, the movie is a great masterpiece, full of wise quotes, through a fantastic story, great characters, played by fantastic actors. Especially the performance of Robin Williams as English teacher John Keating.

Great movie!",10

"It should be titled ""The Suicide Society"".","I don't need to watch this film again. I watched it once, many years ago. I think I saw it on television, because I couldn't afford to see it in the theater. I watched it around 1990. When I converted to the Catholic faith in 2012, I for the first time ever in my life walked past the O'dea High School, which is located across the street from Saint James Cathedral in Seattle Washington. I'm certain you can imagine my shock. There at O'dea was the courtyard that I saw in Dead Poets Society film. This courtyard had special significance in the Dead Poets Society film, because the Teacher played by Robin Williams provoked a student to commit suicide in that courtyard. I could only conclude that Seattle Catholic community helped this film crew to record that suicide scene here in Seattle, Washington. If the Seattle Archdiocese did not know that this happened, why didn't they know? There have been cameras filming everything on this planet since at least 1968. If they did know, which is more likely, why would the Catholic Archdiocese promote suicidal ideation, as connected to instruction at a school? Because Robin Williams' character, the teacher, tortured this student until he committed suicide in this courtyard. If the director, cast and crew of this film knew me at all in 1989, they would know that I had never in my life visited Saint James Cathedral. So, they couldn't possibly have made the scene just to upset me. I was not a Catholic then. Why would they have filmed that scene here in Seattle, if the University in the film is located elsewhere? Alternatively, if they had filmed the whole thing in Seattle, manipulating the camera so it looked like some other States' Ivy League University, why did they do that? I was raised Protestant. My family hates the Catholic Church. I met a Catholic man in 1989, and we then married in 1991.",1

"Success comes from doing what we love. Otherwise, we're just wasting precious time on things we hate.""","This movie should be a must-watch for every man and woman who wants to become or is already a teacher. Without watching this movie, no one should start teaching. That's the ultimate truth, I believe. It offers a lifetime learning opportunity. Every word in this movie is a lesson on making difficult things work in a simple, easy way. It also sheds light on the social norms we often adhere to, even if we don't like them. Sadly, many of us still follow these norms, sacrificing our happiness.

The reality is that older individuals, who may have a few years left to live, often believe they know everything and dismiss those who disagree with their perspectives as foolish or unrealistic. However, younger people can understand multiple perspectives that older individuals may not even imagine.

Carpe diem!,"'Dead Poets Society' is one of the finest movies you'll ever watch. An inspiring, tear-jerky and moving story told in the most strict manner. Filmmaker Peter Weir knows he's a legend, he knows his ""Type"" of Cinema touches a chord. He has achieved so much.

'Dead Poets Society' is the story of every human being. Free-Will, Confidence, Love and Hope... isn't this all we heed for? I sure do, and that's the reason why I weeped in my seat while watching this acclaimed 1989 film. It's a film that brings back your good-old Study Years in you, those moments, aha, life was ""WOW"" then. Carpe diem, indeed!

Peter Weir makes astonishing cinema in 'Dead Poets Society'. Sure, 'The Truman Show' remains as his and cinema's finest film to date. But, let's not forget this came way before 'The Truman Show'. Weir, you are simply an inspiration! The Cinematography is wonderful, so is the editing.

Robin Williams delivers a very fine performance. But the show-stealer in here is, Robert Sean Leonard. As a youngster named as Neil Perry, he pitches in an incredible performance from start to end.

On the whole, 'Dead Poets Society' has everything working on it's advantage. This is CINEMA At It's Very Best! Two Thumbs Up!",10
Conventional but heart-felt and intelligent,"Robin Williams gives his best performance since George Roy Hill's The World According to Garp film adaptation. This film is no parody of Irving's masterpiece but it is a parody nevertheless. I appreciate anything that takes on such an insightful topic such as poetry or literature however. That is the intelligent aspect that gives Weir's film the power it possesses. Williams is outstanding and is given a talented cast of young actors to work alongside. What I really enjoyed was the Beatnik style of the script, which provides a great reflection on teenage counterculture which reminded me gladly of the preachings and work of Allen Ginsberg.",8

That should be your indication of the profound nature of the message, and the way it was delivered. This movie really gives you something to think about and apply to your individual life. To make it extraordinary! To seize the day! Take risks and LIVE!

It's an important movie that everyone watches.

A great depiction of chaos, order, tyranny, anarchy, oppression and individual liberty!

There is a lot here that you can unpack if you want.

Great performances all around.

Fantastic script, believable dialogue.

"Seize the Day,","Dead Poets Society is a brilliant movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a powerful and inspirational film with very sweet, true messages that apply to the lives of everyone, to seize the day, make your life extraordinary and to follow your dreams. The complexities and challenges facing this are also chronicled here, as there will always be people holding you back from being who you want to be.

The only issue I really had with this movie was that there were far too many young adults to follow that none of them, other than Neil, are properly developed. We do not get a huge amount of scope for the rest of them, I certainly would liked to have seen more development there.

Robin Williams is, of course, the movies highlight, he plays the inspirational teacher John Keating, easily one of the greatest characters ever written for a film. Willliams gets the opportunity to deliver all levels of performance, he has dramatic scenes, comedic ones, he gets to do impressions. He showcases all of his talents with Keating while still delivering a pure, honest performance, as well as terrific chemistry between himself and the younger cast members.

The message of the film is strong, evident and inspirational, it does not sugarcoat the challenges of concurring your dreams and it shows how happy it can truly make you. Heartwarming, dramatic and very powerful, I would highly recommend Dead Poets Society to anyone looking for a good drama.

At an exclusive prep school, the arrival of an unconventional English teacher changes the lives of a group of young students with his wise and positive outlook on life.

Best Performance: Robin Williams",9
Heartfelt and Just Amazing! I Cried,"I went to the CD shop and found this movie Disc. I never thought how it would make me cry and sad but i got the pecious message from this movie.

I don't know how to write my review properly who came to read the reviews but one thing i am sure about is that Watching this movie can lift your life somehow no matter how old you are. You will get this Beautiful message of the movie in the end.

Please Watch it now!!!",10
Don't kill the poet,"At first glance, I had high expectations of the film. A bunch of adolescent kids, hopefully messed and filled to the brim with issues, will bond and overcome life with the help of poetry. But no.. just a bunch of spoiled brats who apparently don't even care about poetry, start an abrupt poetry thing for god knows why. And what the hell is Ethan hawk's character? What does he serve? He's not only one dimensional, he's also irritating and useless and thought he did something at the end of the movie.

Wouldn't speak much about robin william's character either; just an insufferable teacher who thinks spitting some old verses around means you'll change a generation.",4
...,"Dead Poets Society is a dramatic and realistic film. The story takes place in 1959 at Welton School, a prep school for boys. School is not only a social institution for students to study, but also an epitome of society. Peter Weir, the director, shows the contradictions in human nature and society in many of his films. He got great success with this film, since it grossed $235,900,000 in 1989 with an estimated budget of $16,400,000.

Robert Sean Leonard acts as a special English teacher named Mr. Keating who has an amazing sense of humor. Robin Williams, who earned himself an Oscar nomination, plays Neil Perry as a young student whose passion for acting is smothered in fear of his father's wrath and his parents' domination of his life. The English teacher tries creative ways to let the students notice their own voices. For Neil, whose life plan that is controlled by his parents, this is a problem. As I know, being a Chinese student myself, Neil is a typical delegate of a group who are dutiful to their parents' wishes and study hard for them. Through this story, the viewers may empathize with Neil and the hope of change that comes from the English teacher.

Mr. Keating, a former student at the school, begins working in this school as an English teacher. His unique teaching methods inspire students to find themselves, love the poems, and ""seize the day,"" as he says to his students in their first class, standing in front of a picture of the former students who had passed on. He reminds students to look at things in different ways. The movie climax is when Neil chooses to go against his father's wishes and perform in the school play. Things change before the day of the play's performance when Neil's father discovers his son is acting. He is disappointed and angry with Neil, and will not let his son go.

Most of the main characters in the movie are dynamic, meaning they change from the beginning to the end. Neil turns from being a rule-follower to an independent-thinker, which shows in the end of the story in a special way. Todd, a shy student, becomes more confident. Mr. Keating loves teaching them, but is discouraged at Datton.

The theme or message of this movie is to seize the day. Watching this story, you are happy for the students for being themselves, but you are also sad that because they are following their heart, they are punished also.

After watching this dramatic and realistic film, I feel totally different at the end of the film and have a question for myself and others: should we follow our hearts, or do what our parents expect us to do? Sometimes what society wants from us is different than what we want for ourselves. Maybe you will fear being ""different"" from others, but being different is not always wrong. You may lose something by being independent, but you will also gain some other things. If you follow your strong beliefs and make good, responsible decisions, you can be the best at what you choose.

To be or not to be, that is a choice for us. You should promote yourself, not destroy yourself. You need to show your feelings and who you are to let people understand you.

Dead Poets Society is a rare movie showing choices for education and for life. You can seize the day or just do what other people want you to do. It's a memorable movie with creative ideas and a dramatic plot. The movie will not only bathe you with happiness, but also make you think about yourself and your life. Life, for all of us, starts as a blank canvas; what we paint on that is our choice.",10
An inspirational movie.,"This is a really terrific film for the coming of age generation. Teenagers tend to have the view that they are invincible and this movie made me see that we only have one life and it is tragically short. The poem in the film "" I went to the woods today as I wanted to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to put to rest all that was not life and not when I come to die discover I had not lived"" inspired me to set goals and try and meet them to the best of my ability.",8
powerful film!,"Really powerful...

This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor.The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to.

I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie",8
A masterpiece with the lord robin,"This is my favorite movie of all times, the acting is sublime and is very powerful stay there in your chair and feel the character talk to you, I recommend this movie to dreamers, life dreamers..",10
"Deep, profound, but also slightly dark in parts","Intelligent, inspiring, and insightful. These are the qualities that come to my mind when watching this movie. Shot by the magnanimous Peter Weir who also directed The Truman Show, I knew we were in for a treat.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for the most part. The movie deals with a new English teacher John Keating joining a prestigious boys preparatory boarding school Welton Academy to teach a class on poetry. Instead of teaching the curriculum, he teaches people to think for themselves. He uses poetry as a means to teach profound truths using slightly unconventional teaching methods.

Many of these lessons that Keaton teaches are profound e.g. ""Carpe Diem"" or ""Seize the day"". It is as though Keating is teaching to us the audience through the big screen. As Keating eloquently recites, ""And this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."" He is inspiring people to take a chance, to be the person they want to be, to do what they want to do. And not to be bound down by conformity and strict adherence to man-made rules and regulations.

Unfortunately, this profound truth is not matched with the appropriate wisdom on how to properly apply it in the minds of these teenage boys. We see the unintended negative consequences of people doing whatever they want without regards to consequences or feelings of others. As the audience, we get to learn vicariously from their mistakes on how not to misapply this knowledge.

Unfortunately there is one aspect of the movie I thoroughly disagree with. I will not reveal it in this spoiler-free review but you will know it when you see it. That is never the answer to any situation. Life is affirming. There is always a more positive way of seeing things.

There are other themes that this movie explores as well mainly around standing up for what you believe in and more. Overall, aside from that one hiccup, I enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it especially to those who may not be living their lives to the fullest for one reason or another to watch this just once.",8
Do things that you haven't done,"The teacher's unconventional teaching methods inspire a profound transformation in his students. His approach emphasizes the importance of poetry and literature as vehicles for self-discovery and emotional expression. Actually, his teaching shows that we learn poetry for finding ourselves not for memorizing them just for the test and this way of learning can inspire us to the things that we haven't done or the things we like to do and also he was the only candle which was burning and could show the appropriate way to live and learn correctly. The scenes where the teacher encourages his students to look at the world from different perspectives and to appreciate life's beauty resonate with viewers, particularly those seeking guidance and meaning during turbulent times in their lives. Students often find themselves inspired by teachers who ignite their passions and challenge them to think critically. The teacher's influence embodies the ideal of education as a liberating force, showing that when educators support individual exploration, students can flourish. Nobody was able to find electricity without exploration. Not only can exploration help us to flourish and live in the way that we like, but also we can help our community with finding and exploring new things. All in all we need to explore this unlimited world and we need a teacher like Keating to show this dark way like a candle.",10
"Moving, touching, powerful","Oh Captain, my Captain. How much more weight this beautiful film holds now that Robin is gone; a loss that still hurts 6 years later.

Who should we blame about Neil's death?,"Who should we blame, why Neil died. Should it be the Welton Academy? Mr. Keating? Mr. Perry? or himself? Who should we blame why Neil killed himself. Jus t give your opinion and answer this question please.I have watched this movie, at a film viewing in a school. Our teacher asked us who should we blame why he killed himself. But many ideas rose and we don't which should we agree with.

Is it Keating?

Is it Perry's dad?

Is it the school?

Is it Neil's?",10
"""O, Captain! My Captain!""","In the middle of the twentieth century, a group of teenagers in an elite boarding school got a new professor of English language and literature. While the school strictly adheres to the motto: ""Tradition. Honor. Discipline. Excellence."", reminiscent more of a military than an educational institution, Professor Keating, played in his recognizable manner by the legendary Robin Williams, through poetry and his unusual, somewhat eccentric methods, tries to teach young men to use their heads, find their true natures and stand up for themselves.

""Dead Poets Society"" won an Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, while the Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor in a Leading Role remained only in the nominations. My impressions are quite the opposite. The script is generally good, especially the selection of poetry, monologues and dialogues, but it is not particularly original and there are exaggerated and unconvincing moments. Moreover, one of the main subplots, on which the film essentially relies, seemed totally unbelievable and over-the-top to me, and I consider it an emotional manipulation. On the other hand, the camera and direction create a beautiful atmosphere, the acting of all the important characters is at a high level, and the message and emotions the movie leaves behind (the last scene always brings tears to my eyes) have made it a timeless classic.

Profound,"O Captain! My Captain!

Before you can fall in love with someone else, you have to fall in love with life itself. And you do not do it yourself. No one has any idea about loving life. How are you supposed to love life, what does it mean to love life? You are only taught to live life. To conduct life in a manner that would one day yield something. Money, power, fame, respect.

But once in a lifetime someone comes into your life and shows you what it means to love life. They make you see the beauty in mundane, and the extraordinary in the simple things. They make your heart pound faster and then make it calm down by a quiet whisper. Their words float on the air like fragrance from a flower. They linger around you long after they were spoken. You feel the earth move beneath your feet and your heart thumping loud. Like it is banging a door that opens to the future. And you see a futur with millions of possibilities. You can be whatever you want to be... Even nothing. And you see beauty in that too.

Oh gosh! How beautiful it is to find someone who makes you fall in love with life itself. Who helps you to see life as a poetry, read it verse by verse, in its rhythm and meter, and then one day become poetry yourself...

Mr. John Keating, it would have been my deepest pleasure if I ever had a teacher like you. I most certainly would have fallen in love with my life and with you.

O Captain! My Captain!",10

One of the greatest movies ever,"I watched this movie at an impressionable age and it is still one of my favorite movies. As a surface show, this is a story of a group of young men at a private school who were encouraged to think critically by an English teacher.

Beneath the surface, this movie is a story of men coming of age and learning that life isn't simple or fair. That standing up for oneself and others is the most important thing you can do.

I have seen this movie more times that I can think and I can quote nearly the entire movie yet each time I watch it I am moved to tears and laughter.

It must be said, however, that my daughter had to watch this movie for an English class. She didn't like it. Does the fact that it is required make a movie less interesting? Probably.",10

One element that held my interest was its connection to the English language, which has always been my pride and joy. The film beautifully showcases the power of poetry and literature to inspire and transform lives. The impact of a great teacher is profoundly moving.

If you're thinking about watching this movie, you're in for a treat, mate. You'll relish every minute of it, so don't hesitate! This film is a timeless classic that will leave you contemplating on the importance of following your dreams and the courage to stand up for what you believe in.",10
Carpe Diem !,"'If you want to raise a confirmed atheist, give him a rigid religious unbringing'

There are plenty of quotes in this novel that actually have a greater importance which you can learn from.

The novel Dead Poets Society written by N.H. Kleinbaum in 1989, is about a school called Welton Academy, where orthodox teaching methods clash with an innovative and liberal teacher and also the following consequences.

We saw the movie recently in class where we also talked about the book. When we first had to read the book we did not really liked it because it really mean anything to us. But after we saw the movie and discussed about relevant passages it really interessed us. Our teacher, who reminds me a little bit of Mr. Keating, made us write a class test about this novel . His way of teaching is different than the teaching methods from other teachers. First of all, when we talk in class he talks about a topic very deep and wants us to understand the actual meaning. Besides that, he puts more value on talking about something than just copy and write something. Teenagers often do not think long therm and they dont ""seize the day"". Thats why this movie is very helpful for those who do not know what to do in their life. It encourages us to be free and not get bullied around.

All in all this is a very great movie with a good message which everyone should take to heart.

big schesn",10
Great coming of age story,"This is probably one of the best coming of age films I've ever seen. The anti-authority themes are just so excellent, and the fact that you could argue very easily that Keating was a negative influence on the kids makes the movie that much better to me. It comes off as a little preachy (poetry is great, whatever), but we can also see how Neil's parents may be right about a few things, the dean/head of the school was also fairly reasonable if you look at it without the like, ""main character bias"" or whatever you want to call it.

I think I liked it so much because I used to be like the kids in the film. I used to think movies, tv, books, and ESPECIALLY poetry were a total waste of time. I was focused entirely on science, math, school, tests, stuff like that. My Keating is also an English teacher(s). My Junior and Senior year English teachers encouraged me to read and enjoy it so much more than anyone else in my life. So when I watch this movie, and I see Keating on screen, I'm thinking of my own English teachers (even though they're definitely a lot less intense).

Problems with the film? Not many, but, there were a few. I felt like it was a bit melodramatic at times. No high school aged kids are going to be talking like this in real life, it's definitely over dramatized. The authoritative characters are exaggerated as well, in my opinion. This is all ok though, the plot, acting (especially from Williams), and themes really worked out well for me, I loved them. I'd have to watch the movie again to point out more flaws, on first watches of films I , and I think most people, have a much more positive view than they would after further reflection or rewatches. I think the mark of a really good movie is that it improves as you think about it more (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Schindler's List, and Apocalypse Now being my favorite examples).

I really liked this movie. I think I could consider it one of my favorites for now. All the themes just resonate with my own life so well.",8
O Captain! My Captain! Stand on your desk and re watch it.,"Dead Poets Society is not a film; it's an emotional journey that gets in your blood after the credits roll. If you got yourself all caught up in this review's poignant ending than this will hit your heart.

Peter Weir's 1989 masterpiece goes behind the halls Welton Academy 1989 where tradition and conformity are king.

The story is a testament for viewers who cried at the ending including me - for that impact of what one person can have on the life of another. Also the ending is very simple yet powerful - act of defiance, is gut wrenching, and a moment of hope and loss, which makes Keating's teaching so important.

Beautiful message, beautiful performances, beautiful ending, and it is just timeless. Dead Poets Society doesn't only make you cry, it makes you feel alive.

O Captain! My Captain! Stand on your desk and re watch it.",9
what everybody misses (rental),"Around me, everybody in high school was moved about this movie : we talked about it in classroom. Then, I didn't get along as i didn't go to theater to watch it. Later, I can't remember how i finally picked it but what's sure is that it inspired my love for college and give me a helpful hand when i did my « charlie ».

Now that i watch it as a adult, what strikes me is we all agree that Keating is a wonderful teacher but that's the problem indeed : for me, education is not about content, facts, data but about values, tools, feelings ! in other ways, education isn't standardized cloning but planting software. So in a way, Keating's teaching is the expected program and in that light, he shouldn't be so extraordinary just plain normal! But when i see what happens with my nephews or more generally in France where government tells about « re-foundation » without never putting kids at the center of the values, tools, feelings, I sadly understand that this movie has decades of inspiration left !",10
One of my favorite movies!,"Dead Poets Society is an absolutely marvelous film. It is a true gem. The story is one of the best stories that appeared on the silver screen. Robin Williams did a fantastic performance as Mr. Keating, a teacher at a boarding school who gives inspiration to his classmates to have a mind of their own and to love poetry and other forms of creativity. The kids in his class think he's more than a teacher, and as the movie goes on it shows how the kids need his help with their own problems, and how Keating has a problem of his own that is a major tragedy to the kids. The kids also discover that he was part of a group called the Dead Poets Society where they sneaked out of the High School Boarding School and go to a cave where they read poetry to each other and let it drip from their tongues, like honey. The kids decide to start the group up again themselves, so they go out to the cave, where they read poetry. That's when one of the kids does a very stupid thing which gives away their secret to the school. Not only does this effect their lives, but Mr. Keating's as well. Don't think that this movie is all inspiration. It has many tragedies involving the kids' personal problems. The whole movie fits so well together with all the different stories in it, I have to respect director Peter Weir A LOT! Although Robin Williams does a fantastic performance, Ethan Hawke's character, Todd, was my favorite in this masterpiece. This is definitely up with Gattaca and the Star Wars series as my favorite movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes drama movies. It is a definite masterpiece!",10

The main character (played superbly by Robert Sean Leonard) faces universal conflicts that every man has faced since the beginning of time--which is finding your own destiny and having the courage to create your own path in life. But the problem is treated with the perfect degree of sensitivity, passion and intricacy so that the characters could have in fact been anyone who was watching this movie. All characters are believably touching; along with 'Awakenings', this is Robin Williams' finest work to date.",10
Truly Inspirational,A very inspiring movie! It reminds us that we should make every day of our lives count.,9
Heartstrings get yanked.,"This movie is one of my three all time favorites.

What if we looked at life from a different ""angle""?

What if we push someone too far away from THEIR dream and passion?

What if no one ever challenged their students to grow and take risks?

What if CODE, HONOR, etc... were not just words used as political punching bags, and really meant something to EVERYONE, from the proverbial TOP, to the proverbial BOTTOM, without regard to their OWN reputation alone?

So many characters were pivotal in this movie. I was intrigued by how much one person can influence another, for the better or for the worse. This movie has made me very conscious of what I say, to whom I say it, and how it is said.",9
classic,Always love seeing this movie. It's sad yet inspiring.,9
I recommend to you this movie.,"A teacher Mr.Keating had told their students Carpe Diem that means ""seize the day"" and secret circle called ""Dead poets society."" Students have got accustomed to Mr.Keating's method of education and gradually have changed.

This film is so gripping that I couldn't take my eyes off it. And I was surprised that Mr.Keating's method of education. The scene that Nill who has inner conflict between being a stage actor and doctor finally kills himself warns our education system is wrong. Plus, soundtrack of this film was good in riding a bike scene.

I want to recommend this film to you because it inspires to have a self-confidence which become a owner of himself life.",9
"Oh Captain, My Captain.","This film is truly one of the most remarkable films I have taken the pleasure of watching in a very long.

This film reminded me what it is to be truly captivated by well told story. Characters that make you question your own standing on life and an ambience that is enough to pull tears from the hardest of hearts.

Coming into this film I had a vague idea of the plot, but nothing could've prepared me for what this movie had in store. It's powerful, heartbreaking, and thought provoking. Everything that a good film should be.

It's oh so rare to find films as good as this one, especially nowadays. This is just reminder that to conform is to be boring and vague. A mere clam in a sea of oysters. Something that is worth remembering, or being, is something purely unique. Like every sunset and sunrise, a completely different array of lights and colors cast upon a vast sky never the same as the ones past and never to be repeated.

This movie made me feel poetic. Excellent movie, highly recommend.",10
Well made in every respect,"From a narrative standpoint, Robin Williams isn't the focus of ""Dead Poets Society"", but he does steal the movie; and his costars are no weaklings either, so that's saying something. But this is a story that rails against conformity and academic establishment, and as such, he is well-suited as agitator-in-chief.

I love this movie, from its classical sensibilities to its autumn atmosphere (the photography is stunning). There's a genuine sense of youth here, and the pressures of parental expectation on these men is still relatable (and I've never been apart of that culture); enough so that a troublemaker like Robin Williams feels downright heroic.

This is the kind of movie that just makes your heart swell. And even when it turns to tragedy, the move is organic.

There's warmth all over this thing.

Inspirational,"Movies come and go.... the basis of remembering one from the rest is how it affects one's life. This movie reaches out and does it well!!! It's not fancy or totally tearful, but it makes you think and reflect on your life and do something about it. I watched it at the perfect time in my life.

It's a 10! Watch the movie, if you haven't. Cast your vote for the movie to get its proper recognition.",10
Seize the Day!,"Dead Poet's is one of my favorite movies..okay, my most favorite. I was first introduced to it as a freshman in high school when my drama teacher made us watch it. This same teacher was forced to retire because of conflicts with the administration. So, the story of Neil, Todd and the rest of the Society became very close to our own. We also were big drama people, so the Midsummer Night's Dream scene was pretty cool, too. My favorite character was poor Knox, who is in love with the wrong girl. His antics, and those of Nuwanda, are the funniest in the movie. And I've seen this movie at least a couple dozen times and I still cry when Neil commits suicide and when Mr. Keating is ushered out of Wellton with an ovation of ""O Captain, my Captain!"" I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to Seize the Day!",10
Makes your life extraordinary,"Nowadays, the phrase ""carpe diem"" is referenced to so often that it actually sickens me. You see it pasted into the Favourite Quotes section of every Myspace of every teenage rebel without a cause, trying to display their impulsiveness and individuality by claiming stake over a Latin phrase written two thousand years ago. Tonight, I watched this film for the first time, and for once I feel a little sympathy for those who tell us to ""Seize the day"". It's a testament to the film's strength how overused that phrase is  it may not have been originated from the film, but it certainly popularised it.

The film is set in a 1950s boarding school for boys. Despite how distant and tedious that sounds, Weir quickly introduces us to the main characters and we realise that these teenage boys are not all that different from us. They have the same tendencies, the same overbearing parents, and the same problems with members of the opposite sex. They are real people. It's that emotional bond that Weir establishes so early and establishes so well that makes the rest of the movie so effective. You really feel like ""one of the guys""  you laugh when they do, you cry when they do, and you feel the zest, the zeal, the exhilarance that comes so naturally with being young.

Soon we meet John Keating, the new English teacher. The way I see it, the poetry that he teaches is simply a medium to get his message across. What he really teaches is a life lesson beyond even the scope of poetry: independent thinking and personal liberty. Robin Williams is truly inspirational in his role here, and well-deserved of that Oscar. I think we've all wanted a teacher like Keating in school and I believe this character has touched the souls of many an audience and has turned their lives around, urging them to be better people. We all got the message. The fact that Williams' performance can reach through the screen like that is so rare and incredible. In fact, all of the Dead Poets Society's acting is pretty strong, and this helps us feel what they feel: anguish, indignation, love.

The film weaves through one issue after another, utilising each experience to teach us a lesson, yet we never feel patronised. It reaches the climax but never stoops so low as to conform to a cliché. Towards the end it even asks you the question on who do you side with. I don't want to spoil anything here, but the last scene is nothing short of extraordinary. I actually had tears welling up in my eyes. I can't guarantee the same for you, but in my opinion, this is one of the most powerful and moving endings ever. Ethan Hawke (who was frankly underused in the rest of the film) finally makes a stand for himself and proves that I had not overestimated his talent.

Regardless of what generation you're from, this film will inspire you to ""seize the day"". There, I said it.",9
"Oh Captain, Oh my Captain!","Are you reading this to see whether you should watch or not, Go watch It.

This is the most beautiful movie I have watched. What's special about this movie is you don't watch it like every other movie, you became a part of it. You get to sit in the classroom, make plans in the dorm, write a poem and yawp it. You cry, you dare and rebel. It has the most beautiful shots ever filmed, like your favorite sunny day of school.

The movie is set in a rich private school where a New English school teacher teaches his students to be free thinkers. This may sound boring, but there is not much talking or long elocution to prove the point, you get it what you want from it.

This isn't a movie but a work of poetry!",10
One of the greatest films of all time,If you do not love this movie you lack a soul and I feel pity for you.,10
One of the best films ever made,"Watching this film while thinking that Robin Williams is dead makes it far more heartbreaking. ""Oh Captain, my captain"". So authentic, so realistic, so passionate. No words, one of the best films ever made!",9
Seize the day – The essence of life,"John Keating came to the Welton Academy as a new English teacher. He is a unique teacher so his students were puzzled at first, but they begin adoring. One day, one of the students found Keating established the poetry club called ""Dead Poets Society"" and then, some students decide to reestablish that club.

In this film, some poems that are related to life were quoted. In particular, Horace's ""Carpe diem"" (Seize the day) is the theme of this film so through Keating and students' words and behaviors, this film taught me how should I live my life. Some core students are in trouble in this film so they undergo mental conflicts, and like them, we also be needed to decide carefully for our lives. So, Keating and great poets lead them and us. You'll understand that poems of life tell us what is the essence of our lives if you read ""Carpe diem"" or watch this film. This film is 1989's film, but the young should watch this.

To avoid spoiler, I won't say in detail, but some scenes show characters' emotion very well. Actors behavior, words, shooting scenes strategy, I could understand characters' feeling from them easily.

I think this masterpiece will teach you about life. Please watch this.",9
A true timeless classic - Carpe Diem,"Robin Williams is one of the greats, this film teaches you to follow what you love in spite of what anyone else believes!

Carpe Diem.",10
Brilliant,"This movie is sure a classic and it will stand the test of time. It's a story about rebellion against fossilized views. It's a story about the beauty of freedom. It a story about the struggle to find your own niche in society. It's a movie about loyalty, cowardice, prejudices, breaking the cast, leaving the coop. It's a movie with great actors, from Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) to Dylan Kusman (Richard Cameron). It's one of the best performances by that unbelievably versatile actor Robin Williams. It's simply a great movie. The plot is very well told, the photography is astounding in portraying the oppressive atmosphere of an ultraconservative private boarding school in New England (it looks like New England. Sorry if I'm wrong). It certainly a movie deserving a place in every movie-lover collection. A must see.",10
Magic,"This movie is commendable awesome. Never seen something like this,it teaches a lot about life as a whole,one should definitely watch it.",10
"This movie is simply about finding own identity. Thanks to Mr. Keating,","This movie is simply about finding own identity. Thanks to Mr. Keating, sutdents started to find what they really like and find who they are. I really found this movie interesting mainly because students looked really similar to Korean students. We had to study hard to go to well-known univiersities and earn a lot of money. Students in Korea might feel like they are a machine following what parents say. There is no time for us to find and enjoy our interest and identity. So, I was really fascinated by students started to change, not afraid of standing agians their parents. Also, the scene quoting Walt Whiteman's 'O Me! O Life!' was really moving that I used the scene as a short trailer for my assignment. If you are sick of action, romance, sci-fi, or unrealistic and far-fetched movies, I recommend you to watch this gripping movie that touches your heart.",9
Very tragic and moving story,"Carpe Diem! Seize the day!

Not something encouraged by Welton Academy for boys. Not until John Keating joins the staff that is.

Keating (Robin Williams), himself a graduate of the Academy, encourages the students in his English lessons to think for themselves and realis that they are powerful people, regardless of what they have so far been told.

His unorthodox approach (standing on desks, walks through the corridors, tearing the introduction from books etc.) startle but enliven a small group of students. These activities also bring both students and Keating into conflict with the school authorities and the boys' parents.

Tragedy is alas not far away as the culture clash is too much for the inexperienced young men. Especially so after they revive Keating's own long gone ""Dead Poets Society"", discussing and writing different poetry and different aspects of life than they would normally within the strict confines of the school.

Peter Weir's directing skills join all the characters into a complete narrative.

A wonderful Academy Award winning screenplay brought to life by what can only be described as beautiful acting, Dead Poets Society, like Glengarry Glen Ross, is a study of a particular way of life and in a lot of ways painful to watch.

The young actors are exceptional. Most notably Robert Sean Leonard as Neil who is firmly and strictly controlled by his father (another wonderful performance by Kurtwood Smith). Robin Williams performance is not the centre of this movie, rather the young men and their various troubles. The Keating role is a catalyst in this story and brings the movies two morals to the fore:

think differently be your own man Though there is humour, the tragic results of the clash between the traditionalists and non-conformists is what you take away. Where should the blame lie for these events?

Things to look out for: Robert Sean Leonard is exceptional, Kurtwood Smith plays the tough stern father well, the first of Mr Keating's classes with the boys, tearing the poetry book introductions out, painful interrogations by the headmaster, the final act of defiance

Rating: tragic and moving story, very highly recommended.",9
Carpe Diem,"Wonderful story. Great characters. May Robin Williams live on forever in our hearts. It's a movie that should be shown to your children in how to value yourselves. Not inherently antiestablishment in the typical sense, but points out its flaws.",9
I wish I had a teacher like Robin Williams!,"The first time I saw this movie, I was hooked! I loved everything about it. I loved the storyline, I loved the different sub-plots in it, and i loved the character Robin Williams played. He was funny, but mostly mellow in this one. I thought the director did a good job sending the message out. Change is okay and sometimes change is necessary. I could watch this movie many times and not get bored. The ending is wonderful and brings a tear to my eye. Please watch this movie if you get a chance.",10
One of the best choices of my life,"I've heard this movie quite too frequently and I was pretty much drawn to this movie due to the fact that Robbie Williams was in here. Oh, boy, what a rollercoaster of emotions I 've been throughout this movie. It's really an amazing movie.

It makes me combine practicality with the empowering dear poems and basically made me view the world with this very positive view.

I dare assure you that this movie will make your day and I 100% am willing to accept every consequences to this statement.

So please watch the movie and experience a once in a lifetime experience because this movie's a rare masterpiece.",10
Great!!,"Far from the distinguished acting performance or the course of events, but the story in general is one of the problems we are going through The problem of the old school curriculum that does not take into account every new generation, and parents who force their son to do something they do not want, and a teacher trying to change.",8
"Great film, few flaws","Robin Williams demonstrates his versatility in this movie. He combines his talents as a comic -- the students appear to laugh spontaneously as he improvises and impersonates -- with a capacity to express seriousness, hurt, and even humility. He not only seems to understand very well his character, an inspirational and empathetic teacher with a counterculture approach in a school where the rest of the staff values discipline and tradition, but also to have a feel for classroom education.

The young actors who play the parts of students complement Williams well. Williams does a convincing job as the unique educator who mentors as well as he teaches in part because his students come across very believably, whether taking risks with girls, trying to overcome shyness, masking fear with stubbornness, or struggling with a parent's disapproval.

Only the situation involving Neil Perry's suicide, because of the script and not the performances, strikes me as unlikely, reminding me that I am watching fiction. Yes, teenagers have occasionally resorted to killing themselves when they feel rejected, unloved, or unsupported by the people most important to them, but Neil Perry's reaction to his father's rigidity still seems too extreme, just as his father's attitude seems too inflexible.

I think I could have remained absorbed in the movie until the very end if Mr. Perry had responded to his son's successful theater debut with a tone of condescension and words such as, ""Now... you have had some fun as a dramateur, and that's all well and good, but your mother and I believe that it is time for you to become serious and practical about your future, as you and I have discussed."" Then Neil could have possibly reacted with resignation and some tears, or maybe could have avoided the trip home with his parents by hitching a ride and escaping into the city. He didn't have to shoot himself in the head. That act diminished rather than enhanced the believability of this story.",9
Watch it again and again...,"Dead Poets Society has inspired me in many ways, and I imagine it has inspired others as well. There were many themes covered in this film, the one that stands out the most to me is the cry for individuality, freedom, and expression. The movie takes place in a strict college prep school in the 1950's, where discipline and academics are brainwashed into every student. From the stern headmaster to the scapegoating of John Keating (Robin Williams), this movie provided a great conflict. Keating challenged his students to make their own choices, to be creative and expressive. Above all, he wanted his students to Carpe Diem, to seize the moment, because one day we will be dead.

Each of Keating's feature students are developed well in this movie. You see how each of them struggles to find their own individuality away from their strict parents and the strict guidelines of the school.

I liked the part played by Josh Charles (Knox Overstreet). Knox is madly infatuated with a cheerleader (Alexandra Powers) from a cross-town public high school, but struggles to find the courage to tell her his feelings. The girl is already dating a jerk football player (Colin Irving), which makes matters worse. I feel alot of us have been in that situation before, and we feel we are trapped by this fate. Knox is inspired by John Keating to express his feelings through poetry and a carpe diem approach. The results are charming!

This movie inspired me because I have always loved to write and was a true believer in following your own path, not to just follow the one paved out by the majority. It doesn't mean you have to be odd or outrageous, but to just be yourself, plain and simple.

I read the comments from Theo Robertson, and I must point out that not every student in this movie comes from a wealthy background, like Theo wants us to believe. Robert Sean Leonard plays Neil Perry, the son of a working-class father (played by Curtwood Smith). His father had to work hard to give his family a nice home and to give his son an opportunity to attend a ""rich-kid"" prep school. The conflict comes when Neil wants to become an actor, despite his father being absolutely against it, claiming it was silly and a waste of academic talent. This conflict becomes the focus and climax of the movie.

I don't want to ruin the ending, so if you've never seen Dead Poets Society, or haven't seen it in its entirety, please do! I have seen this film at least 20 times, and I will probably watch it another 20 times before I can no longer seize the day...",10
Extremely good,"This is a powerful, moving film. Very well-written and well-acted. Don't miss this one.",8
Truly Inspiring,"Movies could change your life? Can a single movie motivate you? If that movie is 'Dead Poets Society' then 'YES', a beautiful and inspiring flick ever watched, what so special of this movie? – Well, its special is known to those who suffered the same problem as the boys u see in that movie,John Keating is such a character you never easily forget, you know Robin Williams is few among those who makes you to watch his movie again and again, those boys were great in their performance, 'an orthodox preparatory school'- woof! How could parents just admit their students to such Institutions? General question right? Obviously their overwhelming care, over possessive regarding to their child or in fact over love makes them to sculpt their children according to their ideas, fine 'Dead Poets Society' has something with reality touch, and well I got to know that script has some connection with screen writer Tom Schulman, fine any how thanx for such wonderful movie.",10
One of the best movies ever made,"One of the best movies ever made. Passional, emotional, a lesson for life. It grabs us from start to finish, with exceptional performances.

We miss the extraordinary Robin Williams.",10
Sucking the marrow out of life,"Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time. A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well.

It's movies like this which really bring the education system to light, and make us wonder if perhaps inspirationally different teachers such as the simply wonderful Robin Williams' John Keating were more commonplace, inspiring their students with a sheer passion for language and verse. Teachers who rather than beating the students down by throwing meaningless figures and statistics in their faces, actually encouraged their students to think for themselves, draw their own conclusions, and actually striving to ""seize the day"" and get all that they can out of life, instead of coasting aimlessly through it. It's in this aspect than any viewer with a soft spot for English literature and poetry especially is sure to melt shamelessly towards the sheer passion and emotion associated with them. Rather than poems being sappy and tedious, Keating brings the idea to life with fiery enthusiasm, making the author's sentiments leap off the page and into the heart.

What raises Dead Poets Society from the ranks of other wannabes in its genre of ""education can be good"" films is how genuine and real it all seems, which makes the uplifting message seem all the more affecting, as it never seems contrived or sappy. The characters never once seem contrived, though they may be archetypes, these are real, breathing human beings we are watching, and we connect with them and care for them at a level which is almost unseen in modern movies. It's a genuinely heartwarming and affecting story, sold excellently by screenwriter Tom Schulman and driven home by the superb cast and seamless direction by the wonderful Peter Weir. Weir has a knack for filling his films with single unforgettable images, and Dead Poets Society is perhaps the most potent in this aspect - there are too many unforgettable scenes and shots to be counted, from Knox Overstreet riding his bike down the hill, scattering a flock of geese which fly up into the amber sunset, the soccer game where the students carry Mr. Keating on their shoulders, and of course the classic standing on desks scene. Without giving away the film's plot, safe to say this is a movie which sticks in your head for weeks to come. The film does on occasion show the slightest stumble in terms of plot or pacing, and not all audiences may buy into the sentimentality of the plot, but these are pittances for a film as genuine, affecting and simply spectacular as this.

The simply wonderful cast, full mostly of previously unknown actors is what really brings the film to life, presenting us with a wide variety of realistic, relatable and for the most part, infectiously likable characters. Standouts include a pre-stardom Ethan Hawke as the shy and withdrawn Todd, TV actor Robert Sean Leonard as aspiring actor Neil, Gale Hansen, arguably stealing the show from all but Robin Williams as the wonderfully rebellious Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton, and Josh Charles as the bashfully confident Knox Overstreet. ""That 70s show"" actor Kurtwood Smith proves that no one is better at playing the disproving old fashioned father than he is and Norman Lloyd makes a fiendishly evil villain as the repressive school headmaster. Still, there is no argument that the film without exception belongs to Robin Williams as perhaps the most wonderful teacher figure ever essayed on film. Williams sparks the film ablaze with his fiery passion and enthusiasm, never once going over the top but instead biting back his trademark energy to turn out a serious, superbly fine tuned and tremendously affecting performance, arguably still the best his career has shown.

All in all, Dead Poets Society is one of those movies which actually fit the far too often used category of ""must see"". For all struggling through months and years of tedious, repressive schooling, this movie should prove the perfect antidote, re-affirming the sense of enthusiasm and passion which would make the education system so much easier to bear, and actually inspire students to succeed in life, rather than coasting through with no enjoyment or enthusiasm. Robin Williams gives a superb performance, and director Peter Weir has accomplished a wonderful film which is sweet but not syrupy, passion and sentimentality devoid of sap. For a heartwarming, inspiring and moving movie experience, one need look no further than here.

Awesome...honestly,"This movie, I thought would be the worst ever, But I was extremely mistaken. This is now my favorite movie ever! I have seen it 4 time in the last two weeks! This movie has so many messages to teach, and does it in a spectacular way. Robin Williams is brilliant, and it is very educated in poetry, All Literature lovers and more you will definitely get a lot out of this! Starting with a group of boys who do not even send a glance to Walt Whitemen or Frost, and Then come to a Poetry class that is much different than most...The relationships are tactfully built in this movie... It is simply beautiful, in my opinion... And the way it is set up, is awe-some... I strongly advise this movie to everyone!!!!",10
Pretty inspiring for a comedy,"Dead Poet Society is one of the most classic example of inspiration, that's the whole meaning of the movie ,do what you love or you dream and even if you fail at least you will be in peace with yourself that you try. This movie I was thinking when I started reviewing in IMDb, that I am going to write my personal opinion and whether they be accepted or not ,it is my adding in to the world of entertainment. Pobin Williams is one the best professors ever portals and if he really existed , I would gladly study his lessons. All in all it is one of the best drama and the moments which make it a comedy, are with no question amusing and you really fill happy seen them. To summaries I can not understand why lost the best picture by Driving Miss Daisy and not Born on the 4th of July and Dothe right thing, at least then I could say that it lost against good written ,impactful films , but here is like not giving Mary Curie the Nodel because she is a woman or in this case a comedy, Wow Captain my Captain.",9
The best movie about prep school to date.,"A lot has changed since the 1950s when this film takes place, but the movie captures the essence of prep school perfectly. There great, innovative teachers like Mr. Keating and very traditional instructors who would slap you on the wrist if you made a mistake. More importantly the attitude of the boys is right on in Peter Weir's film. I go to a New England prep school and the way the kids act is dead on, from their pranks to exhibiting their intelligence in other ways such as quoting Whitman as their own stuff to impress some not so smart girls from the town. ""Dead Poets"" also nails down the fact that prep school kids work their butts off at school, and the amounts of pressure put on some kids is astronomical. Technically, Peter Weir's direction is excellent and the cinematography complements him well, but the real treasure of this movie is the acting from all the students especially Ethan Hawke. And oh yeah Robin Williams gives the best performance of his career, hands down.",10
"Dead Poet Society, A dive into poetry, friendship & difficulties","The dead poet society is an exquisite and heart warming cinema directed by Peter Weir. The cinema was released on 2nd June,1989. Since, it has taken a special place in audience's mind. It has been awarded as Academy Award for Original Screenplay and also nominated in numerous category as Best actor as a leading role, Best Picture, Best director, Best Motion picture. The cinema was a commercial success and various Foreign award such as Cesar Award for Best Foreign Film, BAFTA award for Best film was achieved.

The cinema covers the Welton Academy which is an all male elite prep school in America. John Keating, an alumnus of Welton, comes to teach English and his new method of teaching was always baffled the students. Keating taught them that poetry can not be understood rather than felt. His innovative way of teaching attracted the attention of Strict Headmaster Gale Nolan who is opposed to new ways of learning. Through the joy and sorrow, poetry/literature found a new meaning in the student's heart. The ending leads to the rustication of Keating due to one of student's death which was blamed on him.

The plot of the cinema is an interesting theory that we should learn to enjoy what we do. Without sincerity, it is not fruitful to us. Robin Williams starring as Keating is a well portrayed character whom is faithful to his teaching. One of the iconic Latin term used in the cinema is ""Carpe Diem"" which means 'Seize the day'. Classroom, sometimes can be considered as prison if there is no freedom. Keating's new ideas such as teaching outside of the classroom or ripping out the introduction pages is always opposed by other faculties. The free will of life is seemed to be an illusion here. The tragic death of Neil, whom wanted to be in theatre rather than being a doctor is an apt example of illusion. The dead poet society in the cinema is an unofficial club that found when keating was a student in Welton. A small gather of people would go to a certain cave on moonlit night and shout poetry. The origin of the title comes from within the cinema. The more audience explore the cinema, the more they can relate this to their lives at teenage. Keating, here is more than a path shower, he gives the motivation to follow that path. The cinema also establishes a bond between students and teacher which seems to be missing in middle of 19th century. The director, Peter Weir tried to visualise the hardship one has to feel to pursue his passion. How we are controlled by our parents to fulfil their wishes while we slowly decay inside. Also, the cinema portrays that we can learn outside of our classroom and it is a fun thing to do. The director has successfully portrayed the problem of the teenage student to think about the future or follow their passion. The cinema has come through a long period of time and became a cult. The impact of the cinema maybe vary from people to people but that sweet teenage summer, poetry and cheerfulness does come back through the nostalgia the cinema provide.",9
"Carpe diem, because this movie surely does seize its moment","Taking a short break from Francis Ford Copolla movies, I present to you Dead Poets Society, released in 1989 by Touchstone Pictures, a film that, while not my personal favorite, is still a grand old time that I´d still recommend you to watch.

The highlight here is, of course, the character of Mr. Keating, who´s just great to watch in every scene he´s in, from his initially odd, but later fascinating ways of teaching; to his loveable personality; from his memorable philosophies, most notably ""carpe diem"" (seize your moment); to the excellent performance by Robin Williams, in his debatably best movie roll; Mr. Keating is just a lovable character to be around.

In fact, nearly all of the lead characters in the movie are likeable and well-acted, as we see them struggle with life and school, but find their true callings once they learn how to seize their moment, and eventually become happier, braver and not afraid to do things they otherwise were discouraged of doing, which are very powerful character arcs; obviously, not all of them become better people once they seize their moment, but even this turn to the dark side works in favor of the film, as it shows that the ""carpe diem"" philosophy can make someone as innocent as a well-behaved student into a power-obsessed individual who can forget that society has limits.

The movie also has a great and deep look into the idea of poetry, in the sense that it´s not something that´s practiced because ""it´s cute"", but because it´s part of the human race, and that we do poetry because we are passionate, which isn´t something that you usually expect to be told in a movie like this.

The film also has a very realistic portrayal of the modern school system, where children and teens are often bossed around and told to follow rules rather than freely learn topics in their own unique way, while their creativity and individuality are reduced by authoritarian teachers and principals, who impose order and discipline in a place that doesn´t need it whilst following outdated traditions in the system of education. However, the movie doesn´t go too far with this representation, as the teachers in here aren´t portrayed as evil or villain-like, unlike many other school movies, but rather as antagonists who don´t think they´re doing wrong because they were told to follow a broken system and were never taught how to make their classes better and their students less depressed, so really, the true bad guys aren´t the teachers, but rather the whole education system.

If there is one flaw that I have with the movie is that one of the subplots, focusing on the character of Neil Perry, is pretty cliché and unoriginal, as it is yet another one of those stories where the children have to do what their parents say (in this case, Neil wants to become an actor after learning about the philosophies of carpe diem, while his father forces him to attend Harvard to study medicine), which makes the film´s story a tad bit more predictable than it really should´ve. Yes, it does fit into the movie´s themes about seizing your moment, and its resolution is rather shocking, but it´s still just really uninspired, and even cak then it was kind of cliché.

But overall, aside from one very unoriginal subplot, Dead Poets Society remains a great watch, with likeable characters, great performances, an interesting philosophical study of ""carpe diem"", a fascinating look into poetry, and a dark critique of the school system. I´d personally recommend this to anyone, especially teachers, students and Robin Williams fans.",9
Excellent,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a poignant and thought-provoking film that explores the power of nonconformity, individuality, and the importance of seizing the day. Set in the prestigious Welton Academy, a traditional and conservative boys' boarding school, the film follows the arrival of an unconventional English teacher, John Keating.

Keating, a former student of the school himself, challenges the rigid academic environment by encouraging his students to think for themselves, question authority, and embrace their passions. He inspires them to ""seize the day,"" to ""make your mark,"" and to ""find their own voices."" Through Keating's unconventional teaching methods, including poetry readings, dramatic performances, and impromptu gatherings in a hidden cave, the students begin to break free from the constraints of conformity. They rediscover their love for learning, explore their own creativity, and challenge the established norms of the school.

However, their newfound freedom and individuality are met with resistance from the school's conservative administration. The students face pressure to conform and are ultimately forced to confront the consequences of their defiance.

""Dead Poets Society"" is a powerful and moving film that resonates with audiences of all ages. It is a timeless message about the importance of individuality, the power of self-expression, and the courage to pursue one's dreams. The film's poignant exploration of themes such as conformity, rebellion, and the search for meaning in life continues to inspire and challenge viewers to think critically and live authentically.

Robin Williams delivers a captivating performance as John Keating, bringing warmth, humor, and an infectious passion to the role. The young cast also delivers strong performances, capturing the emotional journeys of the students as they navigate the complexities of adolescence and the pressure to conform.

""Dead Poets Society"" is a classic for a reason. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on your own life, your values, and the choices you make. It is a timeless reminder that true education goes beyond rote memorization and encourages critical thinking, creativity, and a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and self-discovery.",10
Dead Poets Society review (My favorite teacher made me do this),"To be honest, I do not really enjoy watching any films. However, Dead Poets Society has caught my attention and now I cannot stop thinking about how good this movie is. It is a 1989 American film directed by Peter Weir. The film stars Robin Williams, who has delivered a great performance and who also was one of the best actors in my opinion!!

The film is set in 1959 at a fictional elite boarding school called Welton Academy, and tells a story of an English Teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry. Mr Keating helps young gentlemen to learn how to enjoy life, how to cherish every second of being alive, how to seize the day.

I absolutely love this film. I am convinced that this is the greatest masterpiece. It did something to my soul, I cannot yet understand what it was. The atmosphere is so comforting. While watching it you feel like one of those light-hearted boys, you want to be them in a way. You understand them, you feel sympathy. You feel the urge to create your own poetry club, even if you hate it. You are astonished with the autumn landscapes.

I recommend this film to everyone. To every single person. You may not like it, it may seem boring or even cliched at first glance. However, I believe that Dead Poets Society is a mesmerising, truly mind-blowing movie that will broaden your horizons, introduce you to another way of seeing life and teach you how to appreciate it.",10
Good,"I vaguely remember this movie but I do remember that I was a little bored, it was okay though just too long.",8
A naked expression of the joy of life,"I remember the first time I saw this movie, I laughed and laughed and laughed and then cried and cried and cried. It gave life a sense of grandeur, of POETRY, that I know that deep down inside, I have. The secret society's adventures and their pursuit of such romantic endeavors will strike a cord within every heart and awake something in the audience. The storyline very much remind me of some sort of a return to the days of chivalry and romance and glories. Along with some very very memorable lines, the beautifully told story will leave you with more to aspire, and more to love.",10
It speaks truth and you feel it. A very special film.,"When this film was released (1989) I saw it with my boyfriend and another couple with whom we worked. My boyfriend and the female of the other couple were completely indifferent to 'Dead Poets Society' and scoffed at it whereas the other guy and I glanced at each other but didn't say a word. We'd ""felt"" something and we knew it.

Yes, I was only 21 but looking back I can now see that this understanding I wordlessly shared with this chap was the first time in my adult life I experienced something akin to what I believe this film does so well. Not only does it encourage young people to not be afraid to live in the moment, to feel, to care, to love because without any of these, life is merely an existence but also to pay heed to what you know in your heart is your own truthful path and it's highly likely to be very different to those of many people around you. And that this is okay.

I love this film. Truly. It has stayed with me ever since that first viewing and has calved out a special niche all of its own; nothing else really compares in many ways. That may sound over the top but for this film, I think it's true. I've seen lots of films since then, of course, but none of them have so easily and effectively raised empathy in me related to the pain and the very human element of hope and desperation we experience in our lives. This film does this so cleanly and with such consideration to how the characters are really feeling at each moment that it doesn't appear you are watching a film at all, more like experiencing what is happening.. And it all seems so.. familiar somehow because it is. Because we've all been teenagers ridden with angst and seemingly insurmountable insecurities inherited from our parent's unhappiness and failings. This film depicts teenagers but adults would do well to watch, learn and remember how to be open again.

Robin Williams was an exceptionally empathetic person and I've always had difficulty watching his ""funny"" roles when it was so excruciatingly obvious that he was in a lot of pain. Yet when I see him in this film, and you can sense all this unhappiness inside him (Ethan Hawke said the same thing apparently), I like to think that this is actually what Robin did so well. He was a teacher and by way of Peter Weir's personable direction, Robin taught us how to care, to feel and to love. That is, those of us who are able, open and willing to really go to places where real emotions are, where real life is. And in real life, as with Robin, it's not always Disney so you won't be laughing – neither because it's ""funny"" nor out of ""relief"".

A very lovely, beautiful and meaningful film. I hope you enjoy it too.",10
Dead Poets Society Review (L&L),"Inspirational movie to watch at all ages. ''Dead Poets Society'' was directed by Peter Weir and produced Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas. It has been published in 1989 and has a total length of 123 minutes. The movie ist about a boys school in Vermont which is named Welton Academy. Most of the teaching is done in a very strict way because of the four pillars of the school. The new english teacher Mr. Keating wants the boys to be free thinkers without thinking of the consequences. The main actor Robin Williams, who plays the role of John Keating fits perfectly in his role. Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry, Ethan Hawk as Todd Anderson, Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet and last but not least Gale Hansen in the role of Charlie Delton represent their characters very well, despite their youth. In our opinion this movie is a great way to rethink your current decisions in order to live a joyful life. While watching this movie you'll think about how you can make your life extraordinary and it shows what an impact your words can have on people. For example how Neil reacts to his fathers words. The director's intention is have an impact on peoples lifes in order to seize their days and that they've got a life to live. He wants that we think about the stories that we could tell in our future because we are maybe for some people an idol. We would recommend the movie because of its great story and amazing message behind it.",9
A life lesson.,"In this film, the life of a conservative school for rich young people is changed by the arrival of a poetry teacher with ideas and unorthodox methods. Directed by Peter Weir, has a screenplay by Tom Schulman and features Robin Williams in the lead role. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and is regarded as the consecration film of Williams' career.

For me, its one of most moving and uplifting films I saw. In a world where the task of teaching is often undervalued by parents, pupils and even by governments, this film shows how a teacher can change the thinking and life of a student, for the best or the worst. In order to teach its enough to know, but to be a good teacher you must have passion. And it is precisely this love of the act of teaching (and what is taught) that transforms and captivates students. Another powerful message that this film conveys is the importance of thinking in an original way, according to our own head, instead of thinking according to what others preach. Finally, the film draws attention to the limited time we have to be better than we are, ""seize the day, and make your lives extraordinary"".

The cast were up to the challenge but Robin Williams holds the whole audience with an accurately and deeply moving performance. The sets and costumes are good, managing to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of schools of rich and privileged students. Photography is regular. The soundtrack is good and makes a good accompaniment of the film.",10
Dead Poet's Society - the adolescent's story of hope,"Dead Poet's Society is a brilliantly scripted movie about growing up and the importance of realizing our true potential. The movie poignantly shows how youthful rebellion is actually the only way that teenagers have of asserting their individuality. Thankfully the young students in this story have an empathic teacher who teaches them not to accept a clichéd world. Some other teacher might have taught them to rebel with violence - which is so easy for misguided youth to learn and do, but not this teacher! The strongest expressions of rebellion he teaches them are tearing up books and standing on the class bench. Beautiful performances by Robin Williams and the bunch of boys - especially the one who commits suicide. A must-see for all teenage students and teachers, and parents who have adolescent children.",8
"Flow, my tears","Oh my God. I have never been so deeply moved by a movie. Never. This is absolutely one of my favourite 5 movies ever. The story about a professor who opens his students' eyes, encouraging them to seize the day is so warm, so honest and heartwarming, I cried like a baby when it ended. This movie made my life different.",10
A very touching movie,This is a movie that at least everyone should see once in there life Robin Williams gives one of best performances he should have one his Oscar for this not good will hunting so yeah one of the best films of the 1980s.,9
A piece of excellent art left to us.,"Whenever I think of Robin Williams, I will think of this movie and all other gems left to us. Your performance give us relief from the hard life and inspiration to live well. Thanks to you. Hope you live well in the other world.",10
"First time: OK, Second time: Wow, Third time: All time favourite","The first time I saw this movie at school and I thought it was OK, but later, when I saw it again and again, I really started to love it. And now it's my all time favourite! The cast is great, the pictures are beautiful and the story is strong.",10
"The power of sensitive. If you cry with this film, you're human.","""Dead Poets Society"" is the masterpiece of Peter Weir also ""The Truman Show"". I think that's the best film of 1989, over another masterpiece ""Driving Miss Daisy"", but i prefer this. It had a lot of sensitive moments and it makes you think. Robin Williams gives his best performance, doing the role of a poetry teacher (John Keating), that shows poetry with a fabulous point of view. Also the film has the first performance of Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and more people. The Screenplay is absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack relaxing and beautiful. The recreation of the college is so credible. Peter Weir one of the best directors of the moment, in my own opinion. He makes good films, originals, amazing... The sensitive in this film has a very important role, it makes you cry, because is a magical story about a group of friends and the relations with another the people, the poetry, the love... If you cry with this film, you're human. One more thing, ""DEAD POETS SOCIETY"" is the best film of 1989. Don't miss it.",10
One of my favorites forever!,"The first time i saw this movie i was sixteen, and i loved it profoundly, not only because it was a terrific film, but because it had a great impact on my life, it moved me deeply.

Like Mr Keaton, played perfectly by Robin Williams, one of my favorite actors ever, this movie made think about the important things that really mattered in life: friendship, courage to be yourself, the beauty and truth of poetry, and the great miracle that was thinking. I found myself wandering, like those boys, what were my dreams; the hopes and goals i had for my life.

Thanks to Dead Poets, i began to appreciate the value of a good movie, and to see it not only as a mere distraction, but also like an event that could improve and enrich my life forever.",10
My most favourite movie of all time !,"I do not want to bore you with all these little details that made me love this movie.... I just want to give you the advice to go and see it if you haven't yet. Dead Poets Society is my most favourite movie of all time. It might change the way you are thinking about life. The music is beautiful, the poems are great and the actors are fabulous. This is a 10.",10
War against society rules,"Its about love, patient, human being Music was great Actor's was great The story line was fantastic. I will see this film over and over again!",10
Follow Your Passion,"O Captain my Captain

The movie is set in the late 60s in an American boarding school. A group of boys become friends and they all take a shine to a particular teacher, Mr Keating. The English teacher that rebels the system and wants them to learn and grow as humans rather than just copy and paste learning from a book. The lessons he teaches aligns with their struggles in Love, passion, friendship, guidance, and being a person.

This is a phenomenal movie and I've seen a review saying it's cringe in 2024, well I believe you have missed the entire point of the movie.

It's a deeply moving movie, the first half is a little slow at times when Robin isn't on screen but this can be argued as there is a lot of set up to do with the boys.

It would be the last hour that is perfect and the last 30 minutes that is some of the best acting I've seen.

You can take so many things from this movie but for me it's follow your dreams, be who you are, don't bend or change for society or because it might not be ""popular"", just go for it, LIVE because at some point you won't get the chance to live again, and if that's not relevant I don't know what is.

Loved it, a 9/10 I never want to watch again.",9
Definite Watch,"Everyone should definitely watch this movie. It changed my life. It's a constant reminder to ""make your life extraordinary,"" because often, we all get caught up in the daily routine of life and what ""we're supposed to be doing"" and we forget to live life to its fullest.

This movie will make your inner-child come out. I would especially recommend it if you are into romanticism and authors such as Thoreau. The poetry exposed in Dead Poets Society is some of the greatest in history, so if you're a literature geek, you should also watch this movie.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 20.",10
"Seamless scriptwriting, direction and performances, with a rousing, meaningful and convincing ending","A very fine film well worth two hours of your life - you won't be checking your watch for one moment, such is the quality and of the seamless screenplay, direction and performances.

It is reminiscent of the magnificent ""If"", as far as being a portrayal of an establishment-fodder factory is concerned, and of many classic ""schooling"" films such as ""Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""From Sir With Love"" (1967) in its theme of the heroic committed teacher going the extra miles purely out of conscientiousness.

It is however curious that the scripwriter could not find a better aphorism for independence of mind and non-conconformity - even admittedly in the context of a repressed and repressive institution such as the college portrayed - than ""caveat emptor"", an ethos associated more closely with self indulgence than with due principled rebellion against stultifying pseudo-conservative tradition. They are strange people, scriptwriters. At least this film got - unusually - a rousing, meaningful and convincing ending.

Like the stellar ""One Flew Over a Cockoo's Best"", it is remarkable that the producer and director managed to find an enlightened relevant institution willing to overlook the implied slight to itself too, lend itself to the project and supply its grounds (and, incredibly, in OFOTCCN, its staff and patients too) for it.

This is Robin William's finest performance, worthy of renown. As with other films employing teenage actors, most notably ""American Graffiti"" (1973), it's always interesting to spot the faces who became big. As, in ""From Sir to Love"" it was Lulu, here it's Ethan Hawke, primarily - scenes with Lara Flynn Boyle apparently having been deleted.",9
The greatest,"Dead Poets Society, brings us a wonderful message with very smooth and uniform filming. You can understand what the point of everything is without knowing that you are getting there.

9/10 because the ending is wonderful and I don't think anyone was expecting it. But I thought they could have gone a little deeper into the other characters.

On the other hand you can feel the pain, the dreaming of the main character getting destroyed, the motivation of the poets, and the pov the professor want to teaching them. You can also call this movie the dead artists society, because in a way it talks about how the system kills artists and their freedom.

This movie is so deep it's literally my roman empire.",9
Seize the Day,"This movie was absolutely wonderful. I've always been a big fan of Robin Williams. He is a great comedic actor, but this incredible dramatic portrayal of John Keating, is what makes this one of my most favorite movies of all times.

Not only is Robin Williams absolutely intriguing, but so is Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and Josh Charles. As Keating's students, they build the plot with their own individual stories, which come together in the end, for an astounding ending, that will make you cheer.",9
Magnificent,OUTSTANDING...Extraordinary acting This movie should do part of the learning in our schools,8
A delicate performance.,"Unorthodox teaching methods shocks school members, but does inspire pupils to think beyond the dull, white collar careers ahead of them. But experiments with freedom come at a price. It radiates intelligence, humanity & warmth through many such small moments. It is an often overlooked screen gem.",10
A must see for all literature lovers!,"I first saw this movie in a literature class back in high school. It was the only movie my teacher showed that year and she showed it for a reason; poetry is powerful and important.

This movie follows the lives of a handful of young men at a conservative private academy. A new English teacher-and former student of the academy-(Robin Williams) shakes things up. He teaches the students not just to READ literature, but to LOVE and APPRECIATE it. However, the student's new found love for poetry causes some problems for them.

Dead Poets Society contains important lessons on life, love and art that, in my opinion, no other movie has ever captured. It is a must see for all literature lovers, English teachers and anyone who has ever stood up for what they wanted.",10
Carpe diem! Iconic! Amazing and genius! Art!,"This movie got multiple messages to tell, one of them is Carpe diem!

Displaying the human uniquness of creating art, dreams, hope and passion!

A critical commitment to conservative pedagogy

A extremely deep, sad, heavy, thought provoking and socially critical and genius film embracing freedom and thinking freely, and our ability to create! Its a film which truly shows what makes us human!

A teacher that stands out with his teaching to give new perspectives and a character to dare to stand up for himself, hes ideals and hes opinions.

Music is great! Great and beautiful filming and editing!

Robin William makes one of his best ever performances. And extremely great performances by all the other actors aswell!

Manuscript is poetry and art itself!

A very important film!

Extremely well-made!

Wonderfull iconic last minutes and ending!

A must-see! I totally recommend it to everyone!",9
Must Watch If You Love Arts,This movie is a masterpiece and a cult. You must watch it if you are a free sole and trapped in you daily routine. This movie inspires and in the end leave you with a question as to what this life really is.,10

Living Truth in Dead Poets,"Well-acted drama. Very touching. One cannot help but feel empathy for this ""phalanx of pubescence,"" struggling at the peak of their youth with self-identity in a world of privilege, pressure and conformity. Their new English teacher, Mr. Keating, is the perfect muse to aid them in exploring a more profound and inquisitive existence. To ""live deliberately."" To love language, and poetry. To discover its meaning in their own lives. And ""Dead Poets Society"" illustrates what a great teacher Mr. Keating was. His students learn, and reveal by way of demonstration, one of the most valuable lessons in life: courage, truth, integrity and honor. It stands as the best evidence of Keating's innocence, dedication and ability. Cinematically brilliant, well-conceived.",9
"The best film ever made,an unquestionably master piece","I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again. In this movie we can watch pretty good performances;emphasizing one or two of them would be unfair because they all are incredible,however I can say I consider Robin William's performance in this film the best of all his filmography. Technically,the whole crew made a unquestionably good work.The BSO worthy of an Oscar is mixed with wonderful landscapes caught with a brilliant photography. Peter Weir surpassed himself too with his work in this film. This film changes the audiences lives and make them feel into the film,because they talk about problems and subjects present in our society and make the audience think deeply about them as well as Mr Keating does in the film.After seen it everybody wants to ""be more"",and you feel you can ""be more"" if you simply ""SEIZE YOUR DAY"".",10
Amazing movie,One of the best films I've ever seen! There's so much good about this movie! The students are terrific and even the dialogues are great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way.,10
A movie to know Carpe Diem,"When I saw the movie the firts time I was in a study group formed by different young professionals and university students. We have a good professors that serve as leader of the group. We were reading about personal development, human groups interaction, etc. Paul Waslawit, Carl Rogers, etc. When I commented on the movie they decide to see it, and as it happens to me, they loved it, as well as our leader. I did not tell them that I wanted to cried but I did not because I was with a friend. The second time I just let some tears to came out. The third time I was crying like a baby. An import note: every time I see it, I find new things in the movie. To me is my favorite movie. I love it a lot, while Mr. Robin Williams is, with Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman, one of my favorite actors.",10
Inspiration for a life-time,"Teenagers, parents, educators, watch out; if you're looking for a film to make you think, and inspire you, this is it. Moving, funny, dramatic. Amazing peformances. One my of most favorite (top 5) movies of all time.",10
"O, Captain my Captain","For years I put off watching this movie thinkin its some lame sappy poetic BS, and all I can say is I regret not watching this movie sooner in life. It just absolutely changed everything. A must see atleast once in your life.",10
Another classic from Peter Weir!,"It took me the master's death to finally watch Dead Poets Society... nearly a quarter of a century after the film was made.

No answers to why it took me so long considering that I've always been a Peter Weir fan. Ever since I watched the haunting 'Picnic at Hanging Rock,' a movie that left me a tad unsettled, confused. I thought about the movie for days after, but eventually ended up in awe of his filmmaking.

'Dead Poet's Society' is simpler; it's got a straightforward story, youth, spice, drama, humour, music all strung together by good performances by the lads at Welton and of course class acting by the recently departed Robin Williams.

Using literature and poetry to deal with a subject like conformism and of the heavy hand that always tries to strike down those who oppose it, was masterfully done.

As a literature student myself, the poets chosen, the verses selected - were all woven in beautifully aiding the story telling.

For me, watching a Peter Weir movie is like sitting quietly, observing a beautiful impressionist painting. Beauty, solitude and a tinge of sadness. And Dead Poets Society is a perfect example.",8
Movie Single Handedly Catapulted me into Puberty,"Heartbreaking movie full of Beautiful Intelligent Boys, Whitman and a New England Fall...what more can you ask for? Oh yeah, Robin Williams.

Sometimes you just forget how good a movie really is. This is the case with Dead Poets Society, for anyone, girls especially, who thought you know who was too cute, brilliant and sensative to die and spent the rest of the day crying about it and hugging your copy of Leaves of Grass, go out and rent it again. You won't be sorry.",10
"Best of the ""Private school"" movies","In Robin Williams first serious role he plays the teacher, father figure, big brother type to boys in a repressive school. The movie has many great elements and plot line. There are also many great acting jobs done by Williams (in more of a supportive role), Hawke, Leanord and especially Smith playing Mr. Perry. If it wasn't for his powerful performance as the overbearing controlling father this movie would not nearly have the impact it does. (It was so good, it was hard to see Smith in the comedic role of the father in ""That 70's show"" nearly 9 years later). Great movie for 14-18 year-olds to watch with the family and spawn discussions about what you want to do with your life and living life the fullest. ""Carpe diem"". 10/10

(BTW ""The Emperor's Club (2002) is a lame turn table on this movie in that the teacher is trying to make them be the opposite. It's OK but pales in comparison).",10
A great film,"Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society is a masterpiece. It achieves showing an interesting story about certain prep school teenagers and the art of teaching. The film is sad but a great drama, and highly enjoyable. I found the performances very convincing and liked the direction of Peter Weir here. The screenplay was written very well, an emotionally charged film. Williams is his best here, its this role that helps shape another great performance of his in 98's Good Will Hunting. I liked this film a lot though, not even comparable to crap films like School Ties or even better than the recent powerful Swedish film Evil, which was brutally violent and got its point across but did not leave as great as impression as this film did, without the violence. A great film, deserves all the praise it receives. --- IMDb Rating: 7.7, my rating: 10/10",10
Great Influence,"This movie influenced my youth and life as young adult more than any other movie. I saw it at least ten times in 1989/90 and it opened my eyes for the beauty of literature and the importance of tolerance and friendship.

Very moving, it still makes me think positive about life and is one of my all-time favorites. 10/10",10
A truly inspiring film.,Dead Poets Society is a truly inspiring piece of film-making. Robin Wiliiams is great in this one and the rest of the cast are good as well. Great direction from Peter Weir and great cinematography by John Seale.,8
Carpe Diem! Follow your dreams!,"Seize the day!. This is the main message this movie tries to convey, and it's not the first nor the last movie to try this. But, for me, it is the one that succeeds best, outclassing even the much acclaimed American Beauty by placing the message into a much deeper, more profound shell.

The story is that of an English Literature teacher who comes to profess into the highschool from which he graduated several years ago, a highschool of great tradition who praised discipline, respect and... well, tradition. John Keating starts by totally surprising his students with his unconventional teaching approach and ends up, in a very short period, by changing his students' way of seeing the world, helping them start thinking for themselves, seeing things through their own eyes, in short, helping them develop a personality.

Of course, all this initiative, doubled by the unusual teaching methods which involved exercises in the courtyard, playing soccer, etc. is not well seen by the other professors and by the children parents. This conflict will evolve into a sad, but extremely touching ending, that manages to transmit the clear message that was intended.

This is a simple but very powerful movie by director Peter Weir (Truman Show, Fearless) and displays one of the best (my favourite) performances by Robin Williams as John Keating together with a very believable interpretation by a group of young actors.

See this movie and try to learn the lesson and live by its teachings. It seems quite hard to do, in a society that usually ""forces"" us into roles that we didn't want to play, but we should never cease to follow our own dreams if we care to feel what means to be alive.",9
Brilliant,"This is one of the movies that will change your life. I've seen it maybe 2 years ago for the first time, and just now for the second. Both times it left me in tears and speechless, unable to concentrate on anything else because I cannot stop thinking about the movie and how one person, someone we never thought would matter to us, can change our life forever. Everything about this movie is just brilliant and it's one of those movies I will always recommend to everyone and will watch over and over again.",10
Make your life extraordinary.,"If you come from a private school you know what all these guys feel, you know that a teacher as Mr. Keating, loved by the students, who tries to make teaching something different, not only classes where the teacher's smart and the students are dumb, is not admitted in a private school. But by mistake he enters this one and teaches his students something more important than literature while teaching it, to seize the day, to make one's life something extraordinary, to see life from a different angle, to do not pay attention to Dr. Prichett Ph.D. The movie shows how a school can change a person, how even can murder a person, just by the system it and the families of the students use to make ""better citizens."" If you haven't seen it, do so, you won't regret it, everybody can learn something.",9
Great Movie!,"The novel ""Dead Poets Society"" by N.H. Kleinbaum and written by Tom Schulman is about a strict highschool ,which is set in Vermont. moreover there is a new teacher with new teching methods and he does not think about consequences.

i saw the movie before Holidays in School. i was expecting a lot of the movie,beacause we red the book before. At the first Minute on the movie got me and i wanted to continue that.

After we had a big disscusion about Mr.Keating and his teaching methods ,i saw how different he was in contrast to the other teachers for example the headmaster gale nolan. Mr Keating is a type of character ,who is open for everything and for everyone . Therefore the students who are more introverted get more self confidet but Keating does not think about the consequences. Dean Nolan,the headmaster of the academy is a strict teacher who advised Keating About the Curriculum ,which is set for the highschool.todd Andersson ,who is the second Generation on this School from his Family , is a silent and introverted character. But after on class with Keating he felt better and get more self confident. I can identify me with Todd Andersson because he is a silent type like me. But otherwise i cvan identify me with Keating too. iam open for everyone.

In conclusion i can advise you to see the movie and make you own opinion of that. carpe diem.Seize the day.",10
This film portrays an atmosphere so real it hurts.,"I know many people who have seen this film and I have not found anyone who was not touched by it, in some way.

Anyone who endured a strict boarding school regime will immediately identify with the film. The battle between the system that wants you to conform, without question, and the needs of a human being to establish an identity and individual character, are beautifully portrayed in this moving film.

This film has had more impact on me and my attitude life than any other film I've ever seen. It also shows that individuality sometimes comes with a price; which will, hopefully, not as serious in real life.",10
Recommended for High School Kids?,"As a substitute teacher, this is the one movie which a lot of teachers seem to leave for their kids in their absence. While I'm not a big fan of ""highly rated"" movies, this movie does have a lot of appeal and a knack for anyone to want to re-read the classics. The only role I liked was Robin Williams as the maniac professor who actually gets through to his students while Kurtwood Smith ("" Last of the Dogmen,,"") plays a father a bit too close to my dad as if he's getting ready for his TV role on ""That 70s Show.""",8
One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time on TV. I was bored and there was nothing to watch, and then the movie started. After only a short while I was entoxicated by it. The actors where god-like. It had a great message. And the ending scene was so good i got chills. And it's always fun to get surprised like that, when you have absolutely no idea about the movie and are bored in front of the TV. It was truly amazing.",10
"Captain, my captain","A good movie moves people and makes them want to watch it twice. Though the translation isn't perfect so that I didn't understand it fully, but which didn't prevent me from flooding inside. 　　 　　For the teacher, John Keating 　　A teacher, who asked his students to rip the preface of the book, who taught every lesson in a unique way, named Keating. You may discover his ambition as well as his misgivings at his first appearing in the opening ceremony of a new term. And I found him a great teacher who made students realize "" Carpe Diem "" which means "" to seize the day "" in his first lesson, who asked his boys to stand on the desk "" to view the world in an new way "", who inspired Todd Anderson whose huge inner talent broke out then, who guided Neal to negotiate with his father and comforted him and assured him not being trapped, who cried badly while discovering the poetry anthology, five centuries of verse, which he had read before and wrote inspiring words on, in Neal's desk, who left at last with his thanks and smile, who is respectable. You may consider Keating had ended with a failure, for his students died or dispelled, for the Dead Society Society broke up and the school turned back to its original tradition at last. But you can't ignore the significant influence he made on his students, on Todd, on Neal, on each member in the Society (though he didn't encourage his students to found it at all), on everyone including us, the spectators. You also can't deny what the boys behaved in the last scene is exactly Keating's triumph. 　　 　　For Neil Perry 　　The excellent guy who owns a virtue of optimism, kind-heart, responsibility, persistence, passion and leadership. And he is also the new founder of Dead Poets Society, an age later. With Neal's encouragement and organization, the Society made its sense. A friend told me that he realized someone would die in the first scene, the picture of former members of the Society, together with the heavy melody in the movie. However, I didn't sense it until Neal took on the coronal and off, in the moon light, naked. Anyway, it's beyond my expectation that he had chosen death as the way to fight against his father's arrangement, order and reproach. Are dreams so gentle in front of the facts? While, just as most poets did, he didn't find a hope in the very verge of despair. 　　How could fate so cruel to such a good boy? I was perplexed, though I didn't burst into tears, a tough stir meant more, and the anguish must be much easier than Todd and Keating. 　　 　　For Todd Anderson 　　Neal's roommate, the boy who is a definitely good student, with all the merits called for in the traditional and principled high school, who turned downed down to go to the carve at first, who wrote and revised his own poem again and again by himself, whose face turned red and anxious in the class while Keating asking students to read their own poems on the platform. And he refused the offer as usual. Nevertheless, he's talent was discovered by Mr. Keating, his captain. He shouted ""his teeth is sweating"" by the inspiration of Keating, and his marvelous inner talent shook everyone, ""Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. Kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying, to the movement we leave dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream"", weren't you? And his significant change proved Keating's success fully. He dare expressed his redemption and regret and miser and thanks in such a courageous way, such an extra ordinate way and such a proper way, to stand on the desk, just as what Keating taught them, and to call ""Captain, my captain"", the greatest name we can call a teacher. 　　 　　To some extent, he is the one with whom I shared most common points, especially at the same age, 3 or 4 years ago, sensitive, introverted, dares not to express his inner heart, self-abased, scholastic. But the difference lies in that he's inspired by Mr. Keating; he's helped by his roommate, Neal. But, who's my Mr. Keating, who's my Neal? And, where are my passions, my dreams now? Have they all gone? I fell so cold, but I decide to find them out.

For dream 　　 　　Fighting against reality, ideal turned out to be fragile. However, in the shine of the dream, the common custom shows its cowardice. If not, betrayer of the Society wouldn't lowered his voice reading ""what is poem"" at the traditional new teacher's order, on the preface that Keating asked them to have ripped, when the captain of his dream saw him. There is surely important to have a dream, but it is even more important to hold it on. That's maybe the reason I failed to cry out, to let out my emotions, because I feel guilty somehow. Times and times, the strong music beats at my heart heavily, and I ask myself where my dreams are. Where are they? Have they deserved me when I am busy study for exams? Or I am left alone because of my laziness and easy-satisfying? 　　 　　I ask my captain, how long it leaves to our fearful trip? 　　Captain answered, don't be afraid, we bound to arriving. 　　I ask my captain, what is the direction of my dream? 　　Captain answered, follow you heart, and heart will tell you. 　　 　 　　Yes, my captain, it's time for me to follow my heart.",9
Whoa...,I watched this movie as a school project and was riveted to the screen with the great performances and the creepy suicide scene. The plot and storyline were good. The great movie was also a rarity since it is one of the few times Robin Williams has played a great role and a serious one at the same time. The ending was expected but I liked it since it was inspiring and greatly anticipated. A definite ten for this movie since it was thought provoking and very well made at the same time.,10
Robin Williams is Extraordinary in his best role.,"This is a beautiful touching Film. This was the type of inspirational movie there's nothing really bad to say about at all. Everyone was magnificent in this particularly Robin Williams who does some truly beautiful, moving, acting and establishes himself as far more then a comedy actor. This is also a movie(if by chance you HAVEN'T seen-bring a lot of tissue-you will need it as you'll probably be crying your eyes out!)

My only complaint isn't about the film but about the fact(and I could be wrong on this) that I didn't see it in the IMDb top 250-now maybe I just missed it-but if any movie deserves to be included this one does. A must see if one hasn't already seen it.",10
A truly beautiful movie,"Remember how I said that there are always films that will change your perceptions, get under your skin, and never come out? I've marked Precious as one such film. I've found yet another that has fallen in the same category - Dead Poets Society.

Dead Poets Society explores going against the status quo and not being afraid of embracing the arts. Todd (Ethan Hawke), an extremely shy boy, has been sent to a school where he makes friends with Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), an intelligent and popular boy. Neil, who has a flair for acting, is under his father's overbearing rule. With the help of their English teacher, Mr Keating (Robin Williams), and a handful of their schoolmates, Todd and Neil learn that being different isn't all that bad.

This movie is ideally juxtaposed to conformism, and that's what I absolutely love about it. Right now, everyone wants to earn O level grades, get into a good JC, end up in a good university, get a good job, start a good life, and be good until they day we die. We are so caught up in being 'good' and comfortable, that being different irks us.

This movie emphasises the great pleasure of life, and that we have a basic moral obligation to making the best of it. Ultimately, the world is our oyster. The only thing standing in our way to greatness is us. We set our standards, our limitations, our capabilities. This is why we have to break out of our comfort zones in order to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"". Rising up against the norm is what we have to do; to treasure what makes us happy, and to get rid of what doesn't.

Dead Poets Society is a true gem, an exhilarating masterpiece, a movie that has made me want to live, laugh and love more. A truly beautiful movie, 10/10.

Carpe diem. Seize the day, dear readers, make your lives extraordinary.",10
The Best Movie ever made!,"This is my all time favourite movie! Robin Williams and Ethan Hawk are both just superb. More movies like this one, please! The ending always leaves me crying my eyes out. I love this movie!",10
Unique and Instructor,"I enjoyed every moment of the film and this film touched my heart and I recommend to all teenagers and young people to watch this film and I wish that all human beings have the chance to be educated at a sensitive age, under the supervision of awareness teachers. Life lessons are the most important lessons to be taught in school. A strong film with strong text and strong actors ...",10
Robin Williams Shines,"Knowing that Robin Williams would play a lead role in this story, I had high expectations, and I believe they were well-founded, as the character of John Keating is ideal for Williams, who knows how to impact the lives of others, and essentially, that is Keating's role with his students. That said, I must add that everyone gave a very good performance in their respective roles; however, Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Gale Hansen stood out. Additionally, there are very impactful scenes that really make you reflect on life and that could undoubtedly change the lives of the students; therefore, I must praise the writing of such dialogues. Whether it's the first carpe diem, the march of eccentricity, or Anderson's public confrontation, each of them was striking and outstanding. The only thing I find some displeasure with is the harsh reality of the contexts presented, whether it's the school's obtuse blindness, the coldness of the parents, or the indifference of certain classmates. Not because it was a mistake by the writer, but because that is the raw reality of our world, and even in this work, it is hard to digest. I must admit that this work is not for everyone, as it doesn't have a narrative rhythm with great ups and downs, nor captivating events, nor shiny ornaments; however, as a writer, it is impossible for me to deny my predisposition to love it.",10
"A Great Film, Making Me Want To ""Carpe Diem""","Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir and is the story of a group of boys that attend a boarding school called Welton Academy, in the 1950's. These boys' futures have all been planned out by their rich parents, and are basically bred to be nothing short of lawyers and doctors. Eventually, their English teacher leaves the school, and is replaced by a new teacher, named Mr. Keating, played by Robin Williams. Keating teaches them how to do something that they've never known before: how to live. He tells them to ""Carpe Diem,"" or seize the day, so that they can live their own lives, not their parents.

Dead Poets Society is considered one of Robin Williams' best movies, and I can't see why it's called this. Now, he does good in the film, yes, but it isn't his movie. Although he is casted as the main character, he's not. He's really the mentor of the film, and the main character is provided through the boys, whose variety of personalities gives every audience member someone to relate to in one way or another. I wouldn't call this movie a Robin Williams movie at all, because it's an amazing stand alone film, that just happens to feature Williams as a supporting character.

Now, the above paragraph shouldn't stop anyone from thinking this is a good film, because it surely is. The movie has many underlying themes, the main one being to Carpe Diem, which is a quote I've been familiar with for a long time. I've known what this means for a while now, yet this movie still affected the way I view the common phrase. I say common because one may hear this a lot, whether it be from friends, family, or by seeing it on a cheap wooden plaque that hangs on the wall. However film provides a whole new perspective (another big theme in Dead Poets Society) to the ""common"" phrase. This movie takes the saying and applies it to many things, including poetry, future goals, and just regular things that happens as a young man, told excellently through the characters.

This movie has many great things to offer, including the direction, most of the acting, the script, and the amazing symbolism, as described above. However, one thing I feel that most people have somewhat swept under the rug about this film is the villainous characters in the movie. Debatably the main villain is the headmaster of Welton, Mr. Nolan, played by Norman Lloyd. Now, Mr. Nolan operates the school, and all of the staff and students within it, limitlessly, without restrictions. If he wants something to happen, it happens. If he wanted a student to be expelled, they were expelled. If he wanted a teacher fired, they were fired. That's probably how Mr. Keating became a teacher there in the first place. Now, if I attended Welton, I would be walking on eggshells all the time no matter what. However, if I had a headmaster with the likes of Mr. Nolan, I would wet my pants every time I passed him in the hallway. This guy would scare the crap of me, especially if I knew that he could just expel me anytime that he felt it was a good idea. This is a big element in the movie that I feel isn't mentioned the way it should be, and I was glad to see a great villain in a great film, since that's somewhat rare nowadays.

The other positive I'll mention is the characters. The characters, mostly of the boys, were amazing characters. Although I didn't love all of the actors, I think the script paid amazing homage to the type of young men they were, and made them very relatable. In one way or another, I could relate to every single one of the boys in the movie, from quiet Todd (Ethan Hawke), to gregarious Charlie, nicknamed ""Nuwanda"" (Gale Hansen). The only casting choices I didn't completely approve of was that of Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet, who, I felt, could've done better as this character. For those who haven't seen it, Knox's main issue is his utter infatuation with a beautiful girl from a public school, named Chris, played by Alexandra Powers. Being a pubescent boy ""in love"" with this girl, I thought he could've done better, or have been replaced completely.

Now, the one big negative I have with Dead Poets Society is the, well, the Robin-Williams-isms throughout this film. Not that Williams does bad, but he seemingly has to slip in his personal qualities into the character of Mr. Keating, such as doing funny impressions of John Wayne and Marlon Brando while citing a serious quote from Shakespeare. Now, I'm no kill joy, and I understand it was written for comic relief, but there was enough funny parts slipped into Keating's interactions with the boys, that the characteristics of Robin Williams himself didn't need to be mixed into the concoction of Mr. Keating's character. This also caught the viewer a bit off guard, when a serious scene suddenly busted into the boys laughing a joke that wasn't all that funny, which took away from the realism of the movie.

In short, Dead Poets Society is an amazing film, with great acting, characters, a good script, and fantastic underlying themes that compels the audience to go out there and ""seize the day.""",9
Spectacular,"This movie is inspiring on so many levels . If you haven't seen it, I would highly encourage you to, as it gives you such inspiration to make yourself a better life .",10
One of the greatest!,"I'm stunned and have no words to say... this movie is epic , it touched my soul , I can't believe I've watched it till now.",10
Fantastic,I have been a Robin Williams fan for years and I believe that this might be one of his best films. There was never a truly slow moment and it is an inspiring film for all ages.,9
Refreshing,"Beautifully directed and with an Oscar-winning story, Dead Poets is an often overlooked screen gem. Itís notable also for a baby-faced Ethan Hawke and a premium performance from Robin Williams.",10
Didn't see the bleak turn coming,"As someone who lived in a boarding school for a few years, the theme of conformity vs individuality seems fitting. The openning scenes really drives the point home, repeating tradition, discipline etc.

Robin Williams as the funny, thoughtful and spontaneous teacher Keating brings a 10/10 performance. The character seems to be made for him. Or maybe he just makes the role his own, persistently being the opposite of the surrounding stiff regimented school routine. The bond between the students is truly endearing with Keating's influence making the difference on their outlook on life. Does Knox fight for the girl without the inspirational teacher, perhaps not.

The sub-theme of Neil's authoritarian father also works, although the resolution of that conflict comes off as incoherent. Up untill that point, there was a pervasive sense that the boys are growing and their unique individuality is starting to show. It would have been more gratifying for Neil to be brave and stand up for himself, as Keating passionately advised.

The actor playing Charlie has such swagger, it's unfortunate he didn't become a household name. Overall, special movie with the caveat that the ending could be seen as melodramatic.",8
The kind to watch over and over,"As someone who falls in love with A Separate Peace and the works of Thoreau and Emerson, I can't imagine a better movie. The simple albeit complexly emotional plot captures the teenage struggle throwing the viewer into fits of nostalgia while simultaneously confronting our present-day selves, unfulfilled and making us regret the day we never had a teacher who shouted at us to seize the day when we seemed young enough to actually do just that. If that weren't enough, the characters deal with the touchy subject of suicide and guilt and sacrifice and altruism vs. selfishness. Fabulous stuff.",10
Private School Heaven or Hell,"If I'd taken note of it at the time I'd forgotten this was a Disney Joint. Along with School Ties three years later it proved to be a masterclass in acting for an entire classroom of 18-year-olds. Interesting to view this movie in light of more recent events in Robin Williams' life. Would Mr. Keating have chosen to end his own life? What the movie makes clear is the fact that most schooling is a plot to train students for a 9-5 assembly line. Creativity and independent thought are to be discouraged or spanked out of kids though canings and paddlings as such are looked down on today. Private schools are seen as an opportunity to meet up with and make associations with the right kind of people from the right backgrounds to become the corporate movers and shakers their parents expect them to become. Any attempt to deviate from this path is strongly discouraged. The miss-guided control parents attempt to exercise over their children's lives is shown to tragic degree in this movie. My dislike of Kurtwood Smith probably stems from watching this film.

I was bussed 25 miles to a consolidated high school, no private residential school for me but this movie brings back memories. I may have had an average in the 90ies but I took great pleasure each June once I'd gotten my exam results in sitting in front of the old drum that fed smoke to our smokehouse and ritually burning an entire year's scribblers and classroom notes. Our books were provided so we had to turn them in at the end of term.

Watching a DVD provides the opportunity to see deleted scenes and other supplements. Watching the young actors 12 years later and now in their 30ies talk about the experience of making the movie makes me feel better about my own memory--they can't agree on some rather basic details.

What this movie drives home in spades is the fact that parents may encourage their children, empower them, give them opportunities to thrive, love them and praise them; but they should not expect to live their lives for them and certainly not fulfil their parents dreams.

I fell in love with Robert Sean Leonard as an actor with this movie and have followed his career ever since. His next movie had him playing Paul Newman's rather straight-laced son in Mr. and Mrs. Bridge, an entirely different role. In Safe Passage he plays a pot smoking free spirit. Leonard is proof that one can be a great actor without becoming a movie star. You've probably seen him in many roles and not even realized who was playing--to my mind that's the mark of a great actor. In this movie he definitely a leader among men.",10
One of those movies that I recommend everyone see at least once.,"Since this movie came out, it has gone on to become one of those movies that everyone loves. Males and females of all ages are captivated by this tale of young private school boys who learn to appreciate English because of one English teacher who cares enough to make them actually think about the ideas behind poetry, rather than just the poems themselves. There is one famous scene in this movie that sticks with everyone who sees it. I think that the greatest movies are made up of lines and scenes like this one. It's the divisional point between a good movie and a great one, and this movie's continuing popularity with viewers is a testimony to how moving this film is. I gave it a 10.",10
Still holds up today as a loveable and life-affirming tale,"A film that's reputation speaks for itself, Dead Poets Society played an important part in many Gen X's lives as an experience that was inspirational and relatable, as well as a call to action to ""seize the day"".

Beloved by many through the year's since its release in 1989, Australian director Peter Weir's Oscar nominated and well-renowned boy school drama holds up well these near 30 years on from its initial release thanks to Weir's carefully constructed direction, the performance of the late Robin Williams and the world class script by Tom Schulman.

Telling the story of a group of teenage boys enrolled in the traditional and up-market Welton Academy private school in the late 1950's, who find themselves embracing life in new ways and looking at the world differently thanks to the teachings of their against the grain poetry teacher John Keating, Poets may lay hold to some slightly cheesy cinematic situations but so important is its messaging and well-meaning intentions, that this matters very little in the grand scheme of things.

Led by one of William's best acting turns, a turn that also reigns in the energetic comic's sensibilities to great effect while also allowing him brief moments of comedic flourish's and eccentricities, Poets also lays hold to some brilliantly realised turns from its young cast members that includes a young Ethan Hawke and some powerful turns from young performers Robert Sean Leonard as Neill Perry and Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet in particular.

It's a testament to Weir's skill as a director that he turns a seemingly simplistic story into something more and while its arguable that not a lot ends up happening through the duration of Poets runtime, it's hard not to be affected by its look at adolescence and finding one's self and purpose in the world thanks to Weir's handling of the material that he never allows his tale to go full Hallmark, marking the films emotionally powerful moments all the more memorable.

It's unlikely we would get a film like Poets made today but that matters little thanks to Weir, Williams and the young cast (many of whom sadly never went on to deliver much acting wise outside of Hawke) who help make Poets a timeless film that gifts us one of the most instantly likeable and inspiring creations in the form of the kind-hearted Keating.

Final Say -

An important part of cinematic history that features many a classic scene, Dead Poets Society may not be a flawless piece of filmmaking but with its heart in the right place and an inspirational life message at its core, Weir's film is deserving of its highly regarded reputation and remains a timeless coming of age tale.

4 ripped book pages out of 5",8
The imagery that is used in this movie to make its message displayed for its audience is so subtle.,"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. I could go on about how this particular cinematic art piece can affect us in many ways. The way the script was written to inspire its audience; how the words they used erupt emotion in its listeners. Each moment in the film captures our very heart and minds exponentially with each passing moment as the movie plays out. Most importantly the imagery that is used in this movie to make its point, light. You just might miss it, but if you pay more attention; you will notice what I mean.",9
Education not Just for Passing Exams,"My God, this film is just so wonderful! Let's look at the physical aspects, beautifully set and filmed to begin. Privileged boys in a privileged setting but rich boys can be unhappy too as is demonstrated by both Robert Sean Leonard's character and that of Ethan Hawke, two very fine leads in this film. I'm not a parent but like the Virgin Suicides this sent a very strong message to me - let your children pursue their dreams not yours. Robin Williams' teacher embodies all that teaching should be, yes you need to pass exams to an extent but education is also about learning about your peers, yourself and appreciating if that is your thing great books, art and performance and tolerance of other beliefs, viewpoints etc than yours even if you don't accept them. What a wonderful thing it is and how it can enable you to see life in such a different manner.

I still cry to this day at the final scene where the boys - they still are really, know an injustice has taken place and finally learn to stand by what they believe in. Seize the day, the moment whatever it never comes again!",10
Academy *pfft*,"Robin was quite good, but he wasn't a lead, so that nomination was questionable. Meanwhile, Ethan Hawke's certainly should have gotten a nomination. His performance in a complex and difficult role is unbelievably convincing even if you don't get the subtext. If you do, it's ten times better.

Of the more subtle moments, the one that always struck me was when the principal was teaching the class and Robin retrieved his things Hawke is desperate to talk to him, but can't. When Robin walks by him, Hawke turns his head to him but of course Robin has to keep walking and Hawke very subtly hangs his head knowing he lost his chance.

Hawke decides to take a *new* chance a few beats after this, but that subtle moment really sells it for me.",9
Just perfect,"This is what I call movie!!! Great story, great acting, great direction just perfect!!!The most touching movie I have ever seen!!! John Keating one of the best professors we have seen in the big screen and in real life too!!I had such a great time that I wished this movie last forever and secretly I hope that one day I will meet such a brilliant teacher!! The best motto ever said to a movie was in Latin ""Carpe Diem"" or in English ""Seize the day"" something we should never forget during our lives!!! If you like that movie you will also like ""To sir with love"" and ""Mona Lisa smile""!!!Of course in my opinion ""Dead poet society"" is the top!!!",10
Terrific film I enjoyed very much....,"I applaud this movie for its subtle characterizations of the various members of a dysfunctional suburban family.

The depths of this movie reach far beyound the mental capabilities of the common person, and is therefor overlooked by most people and critics. This is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made, bar none! on no level, tech,writing, or acting is there any flaw and I defy anyone to find one.

The poetic language added much and helped deliver this movie's power. All the characters are deep and complex but at the same time totally believable and very real. Add to all of this a moving and magnificent (deliberately simple) musical score, a believable script and clever directing by Mr Shulman and you have a movie that is truly well deserving of its Academy Awards and many accolades.

I have yet to see better. 10/10",10
Simply beautiful,"This movie has filled me with joy. Of course there were heart-wrenching moments and I did feel sad, but during the movie and after it ended, I felt like there was a river of excitement running through my body. It was the beauty of art, literature particularly, which I had never deeply understood. And this beautiful, sincere, inspirational piece of art has opened my eyes, and my mind, and my heart. Watching this one was a priceless experience that I had never expected a movie could bring (although I always enjoy watching them). Believe or not this was the first time I've seen Robin William in a feature film and I understood right away why he was so beloved. Such a respectable person!",10
"There is Underrated, Then there's The Dead Poets Society","The fact this is classed as 196 on this Top 100 IMDB films is a crime, This film deserves so much more credibility and recognition for what it is is trying to show and what it is trying to teach by using the phrase Carpé Diem (""Seize The Day"")

Growing up I used to hate and make fun of poetry and used to hate my lessons in English when learning about it to the point where I was close to say to my teacher I wasn't feeling well to get out of class every time, but now 15 years on I understand the point of it and realise the point of going against the road set out for them or if there is a rule break it as that is the way of moving things forward.

During this film you laugh, you cry and you love and you definitely respect people's performances especially Robin William's as he is the one who teaches you the whole Lesson of Seize The Day in a different way instead of the classic white board and writing book, He character uses psychological ways of teaching and even after first seeing this film 2 years ago it still sticks with me.

But one thing is for sure this deserves more than an 8.1 or 196 on this list it. Needs to be easily in the 50s because of the lessons and the concept behind it.",10
Dead Poets Society,"The film beautifully navigates themes of conformity, rebellion, and self-discovery as it follows a group of young men in an elite prep school. Through exceptional performances by the ensemble cast, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, the movie captures the emotional struggles and yearnings of adolescence.

Visually stunning and emotionally resonant, Dead Poets Society continues to captivate audiences with its message of seizing the day and embracing one's authentic self, making it a cinematic gem that inspires and uplifts across generations. I can also personally relate to this movie in the way I have a friend who was forced into going to private boarding school and came back like a completely different human.",9
superb acting and excellent ambience ...,"It remains a favourite because it is at once entertaining, uplifting and utterly tragic. Don't be fooled by the naysayers, the plot and acting are superb. The ambience is amazing.

By the way .... I think people who utterly hate this movie are well-represented by Neil's dad :-(",10
Fabulous!,"I've been lucky enough to have an English teacher much like the fictitious John Keating. My favorite film for sentimental reasons and for cinematographic ones. The story is touching and speaks to the censorship of young people, and it helps people to see the benefits of the arts and enthusiasm in education.",10
One of Robin Willliams's finest performance,"Dead Poets Society is an extraordinary movie that has a lot of meaning. When i watched this film, i found it unlike anything i had ever seen before, it shows you how one teacher can inspire and the change the life for A student, giving the confidence to find their path. I can say that when it comes to a great drama movie, Dead Poets Society should be on your 10 choices list. It may not have won the best picture Oscar, but most importantly, won the people's hearts.

Robin Williams plays an English teacher called John Keating, working in a very prestigious and strict school. He is new to the academy, and has different teaching methods that acquire the students fascination to the subject. No longer are they bored of English, but are dedicated to it, thanks to the teaching methods pf Williams. He teaches his students to stick with their individual beliefs and follow their individual passion. Seize the day.

I wish, i really wish that i had a teacher like John Keating!!",9
"Moving, and beautiful","Dead Poets Society is the best movie ever! Why? Carpe Diem! Seize THE DAY! This movie teaches you that. Along with non conformity, and being open minded. This is a movie everyone should see! BE UNIQUE! BE DIFFERENT! Be a writer, an actor, a singer, a dancer, a lawyer, a judge, a director! Be anything you want to be! This movie is fantastic, and wonderful. Humorous. Fulfilling!

Stand up for what you believe. How you feel. What you want, desire, or crave! Be your own person. Live your own life. Live your life to the fullest, and greatest! This movie has taught me that. Robin Williams at one of his greatest acting experiences ever.",10
An absolute masterpiece,"I remember first hearing about this movie from one of the teacher made us stand on tables as well

When I watched it I cried its so great that anyone who watches it would definitely love it its one of the best movies that I ever watched and will watch it again and again",10
Dear God....,"This film gives a new definition to the word brilliant. It's the most inspiring film I've seen in a long time. Terrific. I watched this film to honour the incredible late actor, comedian, and a patron of other noble professions, Robin Williams. Mr. Keating. Oh Captain, my Captain. To honour his legacy, and in his memory: just yesterday was the anniversary of his death.

All good films must come to an end, the end of this film was a tragic one. And all the while, as much as I wish to be able to write a new one, I'm reminded that the world is what we make it. So, in light of the coming film release of the BFG, and in respect for this delightfully engaging film, I give a message to parents: fuel your children's passions, let 'em dream, give them reason to live and nurture their talents. Teach 'em and give them happiness. In Thoreau's words 'suck out all the marrow in life'. Help your children seek out all every last drop of goodness, teach them to appreciate it. The alternative? Live with, or rather suffer, the consequences.

My own parents wouldn't exactly be open to practising this message, so I understand what it means to be hindered, to have your path chosen for you. And I recognise just how vital it is to not pressure our children to live the life we never did, that we could never have dreamt possible. I hope to have the opportunity, one day, to put my message into practice. I hope you'll join me. And if you have no desire to, then watch this film- I can only hope it will change your decision.

Now because I should actually be reviewing this film, I'll begin. This is the sort of film that can reveal the fractures, the breaking points, the faults of a system, of society. It introduces a new way of thinking, helps tackle blind, ignorant, conformity. Teaches us to raise our voice, to take a stand. This film has the potential to build a new kind of individual: a rebel, an intellectual, someone who earnestly seeks out the opportunity to learn, and create. Someone who makes or breaks tradition- but an individual who doesn't act alone but, with a network of friends. Together, they give rise to a revolution.

To quote from Walt Whitman, as Mr Keating does, 'the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.' And to ask the question Mr Keating gives his students, and one I believe we should all be asked at some point in our lives, ""what will your verse be?""

This film is at the very top of my favourites list!  And I can promise you will love it, dead poet's honour

NB: I realise this review strays from the usual written structure, but I figured all the other reviewers will be able to attest to the fact that the acting was brilliant, casting choices on-point, etc...",10
This movie had me in my feels.,"Dead Poets Society is a beautiful movie. Before I watched the movie, and I had been planning to for a long time, I had no clue about it nor did I have any expectations from it. I just knew that as someone who used poetry and art as a way to escape from reality or as a form of expression and freedom, perhaps this movie was for me. And boy did I feel so.

This movie is a movie that will make you think. It is a movie that will have you considering perhaps, ""what if"" or ""maybe if I..."" in the best way possible. It's a reminder to us, not to conform. To express, to feel, to live, to risk, to think for ourselves, to love. And that isn't something that many movies have achieved for me personally. D. P. S. Made me appreciate and love poetry more- and I did not think I could. As a male myself, and a queer one as that, I could really relate to the toxic masculinity portrayed throughout the movie- the pressure to be something you do not wish to be, the pressure to fit into a box and be okay with it. That soul-crushing expectation weighing on your shoulders before you even have a chance to find your self- your voice.

I must say that looking at this movie from a modern lens you can find some ""flaws"" or maybe a lack of diversity, but this is a movie that came out a while ago. I think for the time it came out it definitely made itself known. I saw many people saying that after finishing this movie they will be affected from it for life. And I think so too, the tears and feelings I felt will not be forgotten~

Carpe Diem.

*Warning; spoilers ahead*

These will just be some personal thoughts! When I was watching the movie, my favourite character was Neil (he still is). I was cheering for him when he finally expressed his feelings to his father. I was so proud of him throughout the play and to be honest I was devastated when things turned out as they did. Neil deserved so much better and it pains me that he never had the chance to even exist in the world. At least he was seen, if not by the people he called family, by his friends and Mr. Keating.

Overall, I think the last scene of the movie was the most rewarding one. Todd, the person of the group who was the least daring was the person who was the most affected by what Keating taught them. He was the first one who gulped, gulped and couldn't take it anymore. Everyone who stood up on that desk might have even gotten expelled- yet at that moment they decided to collectively stand on those desks knowing they will face the consequences. Let's just say if I was Mr. Keating I wouldn't be able to let those kids go as easily- that display of resolve was so moving for me and easily the most iconic scene of the movie! I was crying ever since Neil's suicide and I was constantly overwhelmed after that.

Finally, this movie is worth watching. And I don't know if I would watch it again, it did bring up many memories and situations I'd buried- it definitely left me overthinking and writing this review at 3:23am! But that's precisely why I loved it so much.

This is also my review so I do apologise if this all over the place, and if you made it this far thank you.

I hope I can find my voice, and my self. And I hope to one day publish my own poetry book. Once again, carpe diem!",10
This ending absolutely floored me...,"After hearing nothing but praise from my friends and family, I made the decision to rent Dead Poets Society. Although it was hyped-up a lot by my friends, I tell you that I was not the least bit disappointed. This film lived up to the hype and then some. I'm not gonna waste my time summarizing this film, cause chances are anyone who is reading this has already seen the film. So instead I'm going to briefly touch on the impact this film had on me as an individual. Carpe Diem (sieze the day). That pretty much sums up the feeling that this film instilled in me after viewing it. It made me realize that there are more important things in life than just following ""tradition"" and doing what is expected of you. It showed me that I must follow my own path in life, with what makes me truly happy, rather than conform with what is expected of me. Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie. When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal. You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him. And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the ""establishment"". And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating ""Captain, My Captain!""... I literally wept out loud. I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one. I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits. Anyone that enjoys being moved and touched by a movie MUST see this one. It will also add two important words to your vocabulary.... CARPE DIEM.",9
Carpe Diem!!!,"I watched this movie today and felt so proud to be an English teacher! The movie is very gripping and Robin Williams is just phenomenal as an English Teacher! It also made me miss Robin Williams and wish he was around to deliver more performances like this! As for the movie, I can go on and on with the adjectives but none would do justice to the movie! So it's better if you watch it and be prepared to be seized by it!!",10
Very Inspiring Tale.,"Dead Poets Society.

I usually sleep at 11.00 at night, and I was just about to sleep, when I saw a movie with a bunch of school kids, I like movies with about schools, teachers etc. I watched it for few minutes when Robbin Williams was suddenly introduced as a school teacher, and then the movie became a fun ride full of inspiration, and engaging. I kept watching until the movie was finished, I just couldn't stop watching the movie, for it was ""magical"" literally.

The tale is about a school, teacher, and students. A school filled with traditional, unattractive, depressing teaching methods. Discipline is of highest value, and where discipline is nothing but bashing students until they stop thinking creatively, just to make them High Earning Zombies. Until one day, a teacher(Robbin Williams) comes to this school, as an English teacher, and tries to defy the traditional methods of text book teaching and encouraging students to think creatively, think freely. And then the tale continues in which Robbin Williams inspires a bunch of boys to a level that they truly discover and stand by what they want to do. ""Carpe Diem""(Seize the day), thats what its all about.

Acting wise, Robbin Williams is just amazing. The bunch of boys do so well that one falls in love with their characters. Everything else is absolutely awesome.

A Path Breaking Movie, you will like it. 9/10.",10
Good Movie,"Rating: 8.4 Overall, a coming of age drama that is a bit generic but is carried by Robin Williams' performance and iconic lines as you root for the characters in the end, even though the movie ends very abruptly.

Good Direction, Good Acting (Incredible from Robin Williams (really tailored to his personality and was a good precursor to his role in Good Will Hunting), Good from Robert Sean Leonard, Good from Ethan Hawke (for what he was supposed to portray), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (the generic coming-of-age story in a conservative society), Very Good Screenplay (filled with many iconic quotes and is really carried out well by the cast (especially Robin Williams)), Pretty Good Score, Good Cinematography, Bad Sound (it makes it sounds extremely cartoony and unrealistic (especially in the spanking scenes)), Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was a bit off because the movie just ends at the climax (with no resolution or loose ends even close to being tied), Pacing was good (though there definitely needed to be 10-15 minutes added towards the end because of how abrupt the movie ends), The build to the climax was very well done because you begin to feel for Perry towards the end; the overall climax was fine but the movie just ends at the iconic scene (making it very hard to understand what happens to the characters because there are so many loose ends that are left untied), it is important to point out the plot holes in the movie (especially when Keating probably teaches other students, so like what happens to them; also in the iconic scene not everyone stands up and some of the people who stand up are not even in the Dead Poets Society);the development in all the characters (especially Ethan Hawke's character) makes you want to root for them towards the end; the portrayal of John Keating by Robin Williams needs to be highlighted more (even though it can be argued he was not really the main character (I would argue it is Ethan Hawke's character), he really steals the show with his iconic charm and comedy, but also shows his dramatic acting ability that prepped him for his career defining performance in Good Will Hunting)",8
"A reflective experience, palette cleanser","Dead Poets Society is a simple film centring around the relationships between friends who should be at the transitional age of independence and choosing their life directions, but are struggling with the pressures of a prestigious boys' school full of prestigious families. This film is a real pallet cleanser, especially if you are like me and have been consuming the endless stream of high action movies and series put out in the west. I found the period and accompanying attitudes within which the film was set to be somewhat accurately represented and oddly triggered nostalgia for a time I wasn't born in. There are some truly thought-provoking ideals put forward by Robin Williams' character, ones that I know can lead to adverse consequences if not followed up with more guidance - so if watching with family it might be worth talking through some of those points to the young ones, but the film does a good job of highlighting the positives and negatives of the ideals it puts forward - the sign of a well thought out plot.

In this PG-rated film, for some reason the director thought it would be a good idea if one of the boys holds up a magazine of a lady posing nude - focused on for a good few seconds. Yes we know how teenage boys are in the west and what they get up to, but is visualising that on an otherwise family friendly movie necessary, or does it hinder the story? No parents would want the younger ones in their household to be hit with that shocking scene. Aside from this, the film worth a watch, but can sadly only recommend for older audience due to the afore mentioned, as well as some sexual references smattered here and there (teenage boy-talk).

I watched this on DVD held up surprisingly well with upscaling on a 75 inch screen. This type of film doesn't demand too much in the way of graphical fidelity, the story carries the viewer with it regardless of visual quality. I was certainly satisfied with the DVD quality, and actually it added a certain retro effect that I felt served the film.",8
nice film,"The film in which Robin Williams was very feeling and enjoyable .

Robin Williams was very successful as usual in film.

THE BEST,THE BEST FILM IN THE WORLD IM LITERALLY CRYING OMG,10
Wonderful Movie,"Oh Captain, my Captain! That was a Wonderful movie. I think i'm going to watch it again.",8
I'm in love with dead poets society=),"I'm not very good at English but I will try to say everything I have to say: I love drama and good comedy, not the dirty comedy or just comedy, but that ""comedy"" who makes us laugh. This film is drama and comedy: with this film I can laugh and at the first time I saw this film I was 15 years old and I cried so much in the end... I saw this film in a class, and I started to miss that film so much that I had to buy it! But any shops of my city had it, so I make the film come to me by mail. And now I have it, and I am 16 years old, and I just don't get tired of watching the film. This film talks to me! I can feel it! I grow up so much with this film. That's my movie, my one, my favorite... and it is not because of the handsome guys our the romance, our even because of the poetry, but because the guys a age near of mine, they have dreams like me, I every time I watch this film I want to do more I need to BE MORE! I start to seyse the day like I never did it before, I start to love like I never love before and to fight for what I really want... I think this movie is perfect: even Neil's suicide, because it shows us that we have to be strong. My favorite guy is Charlie Dalton, the unic and the handsome Nuwanda, because we got the attitude and a great personality! And the end... so perfect... I cry 3 times, and I wanted to cry to much more... maybe 6... I love this film with all the words in my blood. This film is my inspiration of life, and I show it to everyone I love and everybody like the film. It's and old film but with great success in 2006... he deserved to with the Oscar of best movie. He didn't, but in my heart, he did win all the Oscars=)

I LOVE DEAD POETS SOCIETY! NUWANDA 4EVER!! I LOVE THIS FILM LIKE I NEVER LOVE ANYTHING BEFORE!!!! SEYSE THE DAAAAAAAAAAAAY!! I LOVE IT!",10
Oh Captain! My Captain!,"This movie is so good!!!!!!!!

It shows us, that you need to size every day and make every minute count. Carpe diem! It also shows us that one teacher can make your life extraordinary in every way. It also demonstrates to see things from other perspectives! And that we need to think for ourselves. It also displays the power of words and poetry's. Words can mean so much if we put the right.

So if you haven't seen that movie watch it! After that movie you will see the world from another perspective! This movie gives hope into friendship. And that teacher and students can have fun in the lesson.",10
